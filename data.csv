I don’t want to pay the $297/month fee,"I get it. If $297 could buy you two clients a month, would you do it?", "Turn $297 into a deal this month!","eXp","Winners don’t ask cost, they ask return."
I’m already paying for leads; why pay again?,"Exactly. You’re renting from Zillow. Would you rather rent your future or own it?", "Stop renting leads, own the machine!","KW","Control your pipeline, control your future."
What if I don’t get ROI on the $300 ad budget?,"The truth is, the system averages $3-5 per lead. One deal pays for a year.", "Every lead lowers your cost per deal.","Compass","Play the long game, win the business."
