The recipe benefit.,general,"The benefits of the only way that I win is, if you win, if you sell some houses, I make a little bit off of what you pay into exp. And my my ultimate goal is to get you out of this place and never in it again. If you want to learn how to recruit agents to exp and introduce them to this opportunity. So let's let's let's imagine. Imagine, 3 months from now you've got 4 pendings. And 2 deals that you've closed from deals. I helped you get. If if you were talking to an agent anywhere in Vancouver, anywhere in the world, for that matter, because you can talk to any agent anywhere, and bring them over to exp and get paid revenue share. Um. And he said, and he said, Man, this shit, let me tell you where I was at. I was living where I was living. I didn't even own I was literally didn't know what my! You know what my next step was going to be. Somehow ended up on a call with these 2 guys. They offered to help me. I took a chance because I didn't have any. I didn't have another choice. I made a move. From roll the page over to exp, hoping that this would work. And let me tell you what happened. Here's where I'm at now. That could be your story. Um. And if you tell agents that they're going to be like, Yeah, I'll watch that video no different than if if you watched all or part of the video. And you got on this call. That's how you got here. That's how we recruit. And so that creates passive income. So right now we got to solve the cash flow right? So. Right now. That's the long term game, because it doesn't add up fast enough to get you out of where you're at. So we got to get you closing a couple of deals a month consistently. Get your your pipeline back full like like what? What's missing? We got to replace. But if we do that and get you back on track. And you're as soon as we get you back to there. And you know where your business is coming from. You're gonna your mindset's gonna shift back to like, okay, I'm back. That's you know. That's what happens. Like I've been through as many ups and downs. Maybe not. As you know. I've had deep, deep valleys. So like the they're the they're the best stories. We can talk about that over a beer sometime. But if if you, if you want the help, we can build everything now. You're probably not in a position to pay for the marketing, so we would have to, you know it's only 300 bucks a month. But if that's if that's the only constraint. I'm willing to bet on you that I can help you. And so what I'm willing to do is I'm willing to put the money on the advertising. As long as you agree to be held accountable by Jeff. And report back on what's happening on a daily basis, as far as that goes. And so you could just pay us a referral fee on the back end until you're up up, and you can afford to take it over, because you would never want to pay me a referral fee. If you could only pay 300 bucks for. A couple of deals a month. Right? Um, so that would be, I mean, that's a that's what I would be offering to do. Um. You gotta move to exp. That's I can't do it any other way. I mean I could. I could. I guess I just don't know how to. I don't I? You'd still have to buy the Crm. Because. Being provided the Crm. And what we put into it.

Jay Kinder_s Personal Meeting Room_s transcript (20).txt,What?,general,,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
Jay Kinder_s Personal Meeting Room_s transcript (20).txt,"Right? Yeah. So you only do Fb and Instagram marketing. Or you also do Google advertising as well. Google, Ppc.",market/geography,"Yeah. So so my, I'll go back to kind of my philosophy. Just so you understand why I do it this way. So my philosophy is, if if I can get you a hundred opportunities in a month. That that's enough opportunities that you can make a sell. Um. If I go to Google, I'm gonna be spending 3 to 4 times cost per lead. And so that means. It would take you 4 months longer to get to the sale that I can create for you, using Facebook and Meta. So it's not so much. And I do like, actually, you know, Google's great. I would say that all the pay-per-click stuff I've ever done. It isn't a better lead. There is intent in what people are searching for, but it doesn't make them a better lead. And so, you know, if the if the leads are all leads are created equal, then we wanna. Generate at the lowest cost the highest quality lead we can. And so with Facebook and the targeting and. And understanding what we run through, chat, gpt so. Let me give you an example. So the answer is, Facebook and Meta Instagram. Those are the 2 that we use, and the reason why is at scale. I know I can do it at 3 to $5 cost per lead, and I can keep your budget at 300. If I told you your budget needed to be a thousand to get to the same result, you would be like, I don't know if I want to do that. And so, if you can do the same thing with $300 that you could do with a thousand, you would rather do it with 300. Right? So. That's the reason we that's the platform we use, and that's the reason why. Um. So what? What we do that's different. And this is getting better every day, thanks to chat, gpt. Is when I take an image of the property in the location that you want to work. And I put it into chat, gpt with an address. And I say, what are the what are the buyers that are buying this price home in this marketplace. Over the last 12 months. It gives me the buyer profile of the people that are actually moving right now. So right now, not everybody's moving. If you're moving from where I'm at in Frisco, Texas. It'll it gave me the personas one is you live in California, Oregon, or or um. Washington. You're moving to Frisco, Texas. And you got a job at Toyota. It's a tech job. You're a dual income family. Your kids are elementary age schools. Your biggest concerns are whatever whatever right. And so, when we understand what the hopes, fears, concerns, desires are of the most likely person to click on this ad. We can create content. That's more specific to. Speaking to them right? So with that particular subset of the market, my video that I might create for for the content that follows up with this in the process that we take you through. Would be the the top 3 incentives you should know about before ever leaving California for Texas or Frisco. Right. That person is absolutely gonna watch that content right? Because they're like. Well, that definitely was for me right? So um, so we can create content that really speaks to what's going on in the mind of the consumer way. Better quality lead when when we do that. The other subset of the market. Here in Frisco is. And this is what Chat Gpt is gonna do for us as we take you through the process. So. Um is. There's people moving from Carrollton and the colony, and there was one other city. I can't remember what it what it told me, but. Those people are moving to Frisco to get their kids in the Frisco school district. Now that makes sense to me being local, that I'm that I should know that. But I didn't know that those were the main cities where people were moving from. It makes sense because the price, the price. Bump up is makes sense that I'm selling this house and moving over here. Um. But you know, people that are trying to get their kids in that school district for sports or academics. It makes sense that that would be the case. But now I can create content for that person that's different. The top 3 things you should know before ever moving your kids into the Frisco school district. That person is going to absolutely click on that. And so the reason we do this is you're going to get a hold of maybe 30 out of a hundred of these people. By just making a phone call when the lead comes in. That means 70% of those opportunities. They don't know you. They're if they answer the phone 5 days from now. They still don't know you, and they don't even remember that they clicked on anything. And so we want them to consume content so that they get to know who you are and you build trust through the marketing. Campaign that we build. And so that person that watches that video is going to be way more likely to respond to the next phone call, text or email. Or they might just pick up the phone and be like, yeah, we watched your videos, we we really want your help. We're thinking about buying something over here. And so we're trying to build a system that's consistently delivering high quality conversations to you on a daily basis. And we help you with implementing all of that. So, and I'm happy to answer more questions. But I just wanted to explain that. That the reason we do the do it, the way we do is because it doesn't really matter what the lead is. If we know who that type of person is on Google, I don't know necessarily where that person is searching from, why, they're searching. They could be looking for. You know they could be right.",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

What are they going to land on when I call them? What's the expectation. Um, you know. I think the difference in the marketing angle that we use versus just maybe somebody doing a home search. I'm not sure what kind of leads those are, but. Um, you know, if you got somebody that'll do it for 2 50, I would test that all day long. That's not a high dollar cost per lead.

That's very specific to talking to those people like for Frisco. It's like. 45% moved from out of State into Texas if they move, and if they're moving to Frisco. They're a dual income family kids, you know, Middle, you know, usually elementary age. Um moving from California, Washington, or Oregon. So you can create content. That's like.

But you, when you, when you run this all through Chat Gpt, get clear on who those are. Then you could create content. That's super relevant. And now. They're more likely to respond to call text or email. They're like, Oh, my God, this is my guy like it. It just makes it easier for you to connect with someone and build trust when you haven't ever spoke to them. The, you know, if we get you a hundred leads at 3 to $5 cost per lead, which is what we'll do. Um, and it'll be probably less, because your average sale price a little less, is usually a little bit less. So. 3 bucks a lead. You're talking about a hundred leads. If you talk to 30 of those people, you're gonna you're gonna sell something. You're gonna probably sell one or 2. Um. But the rest of those people, the 70%. Nobody else ever creates a system for how to help you convert those like you could put drips. And you know, text message. And there's behavioral things that they do that.

Yeah, you should call them so. It's gonna you know, and it's gonna send a text automatically, like. Those are helping with conversion, but like an actual strategy for building trust and positioning you as the expert. So they respond to a call text or email, nobody does that. And so. That you know the the you know. We take you step by step through strategically figuring it out. What are you know? What are the incentives that maybe you're in the marketplace? We can bake into the ad. We go through all of that. But. I think it's the strategy on the back end, you know. And again I can teach this. I can say all this, but if you don't shoot the videos. There's not a lot I can do for you right. But like, if we give you 10 videos to put in that, follow up sequence, you know, 3 months from now you're going to be closing people that that watch videos and think you're a superhero. You know. They look at you like a celebrity. And so, and then, you know, it's like here in Frisco, like when I ran this through Chat gpt. It's it was like another 40 something percent or local area movers moving from the colony. Carrollton and one other city. And the reason those people are moving from there to Frisco is the school district, and I was like that makes total sense. I should know that. But I didn't really know, and I didn't know what percentage of the market it made up. And so, you know, you can talk, you know. Now you can create content speaking directly to those people. And it's. You know you don't know it. You know, the person moving from California is not gonna click on the the top. 3 things you should know before you ever put your kids in Frisco school district right like that. They're they're gonna skip that one. But that person is gonna click on it right? So. So we're just creating more meaningful content and and giving you better chance of. Of creating more of an inbound strategy than outbound. And so, you know, you can turn this up. You can turn it down. You can turn it off. Don't recommend turning it off. That's what most people get real busy and turn it off. And I'm like, that's the last thing you ever want to do. But that's just one pillar, you know. And and you know, we can do that multiple times in different angles and stuff like that. So. It just, you know it's a low cost super land, and it creates a seller and a buyer. So a lot of you know, for the ones that we know that are moving from Carrollton and and the colony that want to get their kids in Frisco school district. Those people still have a house to sell. So now we're creating a listing and a buyer. And so it just. It's the. It's the best thing I've ever seen work, and it works in every market because. Because we're not. It's not beholden to just. One type of ad, or just one big wide top of funnel where we're looking at who's buying today because not everybody is. And the people that are fence sitting. When you show them an incentive of 3.9% financing on new construction that's going to get that person to look where maybe they had not been looking. So you can create a market to a certain extent. And so it just, you know, it's just being strategic with, you know, the tools that we have today to make things more efficient and and um. You know, we implement it. That's the other thing like the big step for us. When I was coming back from Puerto Rico I've had 50 employees. I did not like it, so you know I'm not. I wouldn't, but but because. I've got this core team of really badass people. That I don't ever want to not have to, you know. Like wave my magic magic wand and make something created for me. Cause like. That's the where you how you feel right now. Not having your person is like man. I used to have someone I could just throw this to, and they would do it right like. Like when you don't have that person. It's like being naked like you're like, man, mom, fucking. Have to do this myself. Figure it out. That's the feeling you get.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

So when I saw that. I was like, Okay, well, I can't argue that that's not better, because I can't make more than a hundred percent if I'm independent. And so there's an opportunity to to do that as well at exp. So what? That's what we do. And so if you partnered with us at exp. I do all of this. My team works for you for free.

It's gonna be Matt and then me. And then you. And so it's me, Matt, and every everybody above Matt. That's gonna help. They have the Ari, you know, this is Ario stuff, and all that.

Jay Kinder_s Personal Meeting Room_s transcript (38).txt,Or why did they open up this new? I guess relationship.,general,"Yeah. So so there, the for the exact reason that probably this agent that left Russ is sometimes you join, and and you hope things are going to be better, and you didn't really get the help you needed. And so um, this. This is a problem at every real estate company depending on who you're joined with. You may get value. You may not um, and so it allowed it allowed. More people to get value, that they couldn't get otherwise. And so there's agents in exp that never recruited anyone because they don't know how to help an agent sell more real estate. They're just, you know, that they don't have the resources or whatever. And so now those agents are like, well, I can. I mean, I got a friend that wants to come over, and it's like, well, um, Tina call, who's a good friend of mine in my downline. She's a badass, sells 500 600 homes a year 1,000. Maybe. I don't know. She sells a bunch of real estate. Like, you know, if you could bring in Tina or like, let's say you know somebody if you knew somebody. Let's say you come over, and you're like I got my aunt and is in in Raleigh, North Carolina, and she is awesome. She's in real estate. Um, and you're underneath me so like I'm going to do everything that I do, Matt, me, Matt, ever we're going to do the same things for you and your aunt in Raleigh, North Carolina. But we need somebody that can help her in Raleigh, so we might call Tina. Call and be like Tina. We want to bring you in as the co-sponsor. So Cedric's gonna name you as co-sponsor for your aunt.

Jay Kinder_s Personal Meeting Room_s transcript (39).txt,Uh gotcha. So what is that? What does that co-sponsor mean? What is? How does that work.,recruiting,"It. Just. It just means like when you when you join exp, you have to have a sponsor, so Matt would be your sponsor. What happens is Matt says, Hey, I want to bring Jay in because Jay's gonna help you with all this stuff, and I become. The co-sponsor. So it's, you know, in terms of your upline. It's gonna be Matt and then me. And then you. And so it's me, Matt, and every everybody above Matt. That's gonna help. They have the Ari, you know, this is Ario stuff, and all that. Think that's right. Maybe I'm wrong. Who's who's your upline, Matt?",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE
Jay Kinder_s Personal Meeting Room_s transcript (39).txt,Or why did they open up this new? I guess relationship.,general,"Yeah. So so there, the for the exact reason that probably this agent that left Russ is sometimes you join, and and you hope things are going to be better, and you didn't really get the help you needed. And so um, this. This is a problem at every real estate company depending on who you're joined with. You may get value. You may not um, and so it allowed it allowed. More people to get value, that they couldn't get otherwise. And so there's agents in exp that never recruited anyone because they don't know how to help an agent sell more real estate. They're just, you know, that they don't have the resources or whatever. And so now those agents are like, well, I can. I mean, I got a friend that wants to come over, and it's like, well, um, Tina call, who's a good friend of mine in my downline. She's a badass, sells 500 600 homes a year 1,000. Maybe. I don't know. She sells a bunch of real estate. Like, you know, if you could bring in Tina or like, let's say you know somebody if you knew somebody. Let's say you come over, and you're like I got my aunt and is in in Raleigh, North Carolina, and she is awesome. She's in real estate. Um, and you're underneath me so like I'm going to do everything that I do, Matt, me, Matt, ever we're going to do the same things for you and your aunt in Raleigh, North Carolina. But we need somebody that can help her in Raleigh, so we might call Tina. Call and be like Tina. We want to bring you in as the co-sponsor. So Cedric's gonna name you as co-sponsor for your aunt. And so now now we have somebody boots on the ground to help her there, there, so that it's like for things like that. It works really well.

So we started with just teaching people, hey, these are the things that we would do, you know, and teaching agents how to do those things.

So far I haven't run into this as an issue. So there's there's usually enough lead volume. That you could probably double or triple your ad spend, and still generate and double or triple your lead costs so. There's there's an abundance of people looking all the time. So it's not. It's not been an issue. I'd have to look at that specific area. It doesn't. When you say it, it comes. It doesn't come to mind is that we've ever done it. But I'm not gonna say that we haven't, because we've done all different suburbs of Atlanta before, and have probably some agents still running funnels. Now. So I can look into that and see.

And so so you know, it would make sense that you probably weren't interested enough to watch that webinar, because it's not the problem you're you're trying to solve. Right. So most agents. It is the problem they're trying to solve. And so what what we built? When I came back from Puerto Rico, I said, man. Why am I treating this as 96% margin? Why, why, you know, why don't I. Really increase the value proposition for the agent, which is what I knew they needed all along, because we, when we partnered with agents before we were Exp. We did it all for them, because they the implementation, is. You can teach them everything. They can watch a bunch of videos. They suck at implementation. And so and again, the cool thing about this is like we do all of this, and I never asked for a dime. So it's like, it's not. It's not like. The the thing I hated most about brokerage was when the agent wanted to talk to me about split. I'm like, oh, not again. I hate that conversation. And I would go when I do the math and be like, okay, how many deals did we give you versus? How many deals you did on your own, and it was usually 90%. I gave you all the business 10%. You brought the business to to us. Um until until they've been with us a while. And you know, if you're with me 4 or 5 years, you start getting the repeat, Referral, you kind of own the chain of custody of the clients I gave you the 1st 4 years, and so some of that, you know, it gets to a point where a lot of times it was half the business they were bringing to the table, so that 50 50 split became an issue. And so um, you know, in this model we're just looking for agents that are looking for help, and so when you join exp, they get all the tools that they need, all the resources that they need. And then my team does all their marketing implementation and all of the you know the brain damage part of. What I call I'll call it the brain damage part, just because most people get stuck in. You know the tech and all trying to figure all that out. And we help them. We help them with growing their business. So it becomes, you know, very little effort on your part. You put them on a call with us. We figure out what they're trying to do, and we're like, All right, cool. We'll we'll do all of this for you, and you don't have to ever pay us anything. If you just come partner with the city. Xp, that's basically. That Webinar, you know, gets gets their attention. They would. If you ask most agents, they'll tell you. No, I'm not leaving my brokerage. If they watch that video they'll be like, well, I was gonna leave anyway, like the because the value the value prop is so high. Um, and it's it's the problem they're dealing with. They don't know how to get new customers. Um, you know, the repeat and referral business is usually.",FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

What cloud-based actually meant in terms of. Brokerage relate. You know the brokerage I'm at, and how much more efficient it could be. But. If you got a question for a broker, you're on your phone. 2 clicks away from talking to somebody, and almost instantly, and so. The the cert, because we can do it at scale. It's it's not all under one brick and mortar like the person that's in your office. He's your broker competitor like he has to go sell real estate in order to to make a living on top of own the brokerage. Do all the broker response, like. One person doing all of those roles.

There may or may not return the call. You know, in a timely fashion, whereas in a cloud based model, we've got somebody there right now, if you have a question, you can get an answer to a question instantly. And so, you know, at scale, that's a big deal. So at 80,000 agents, you know, there's not a state that you know we're in 27 countries, and you know every every us state, every every province of Canada. You know, there's, you know, the support, the the support engine for anything that you need, whether it's training, support, help with. You know, any any area. Is far superior in terms of speed and and quality of, you know the support that you have. Because at scale, you know, it has to be able to operate at scale. And then we're not. We're not tied to a physical office location and. One person that you go to, or 2 people that might share a bunch of responsibilities. But I can pull it. We can pull that up and get you know the names of those the state brokers. There's, you know, there's a principal State broker.

Jay Kinder_s Personal Meeting Room_s transcript (61).txt,Where would I be?,market/geography,"Yup. So here's what we recommend in every every market, literally. Every single market we can get 3 to $5 cost per lead. And and sometimes a tweak above that, especially Toronto. It's it's just, you know, your average sale price is higher, but depending on what area we go at, we can get it to 3 to $5 cost per lead. My opinion is you need 75 to 100 leads in order for us to get to the 2 deals a month. And so that's $300 a month. So what I would, what I would say in your in your mind, the way you should think about it is. The worst case. Scenario. Would be 90 days 900 bucks out of pocket before your 1st close transaction. We're going to be working on some some area of this that's not working at optimum. If we're not at that, if we're not at that point. Um, before 90 days. Um. What I've seen on the flip side of that is, I've seen people get 3 deals. They're working in the first.st 3 days, so you know it could work. I expect it to work way faster. When I say, worst case, you're lighting a match to $900 in Ad. Spend, and and we don't. You know we don't. You know that that's if you commit to that. We're there's no way we're not hitting the goal. So you know. But so your out of pocket expense would be $300 this month next month, the next month in ad spend. We don't make a dollar off of that. That's just what goes to Facebook. To drive the traffic to generate the 75 to 100 leads each month. And and that should put us on the track to be closing 2 deals a month.
