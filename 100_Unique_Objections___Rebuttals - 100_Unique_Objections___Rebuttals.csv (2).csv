Objection,100-ZERO Rebuttal,
I don’t want to pay the $297/month fee.,"“I get it. Let me ask you — if $297 could buy you two clients a month, would you do it? One closing pays 10–15K. That’s not an expense, that’s an ATM. Winners don’t ask ‘how much does it cost?’ They ask, ‘how much does it make me?’ So are you ready to turn $297 into a deal this month?”",
I’m already paying for leads; why pay again?,"“Exactly. You’re already paying — but those other leads are retail. Ours are wholesale. We cut cost per lead down to $3–$5. You can keep renting from Zillow, or you can own the machine yourself. Would you rather rent your future or own it?”",
What if I don’t get ROI on the $300 ad budget?,"“Here’s the truth: $300 is one dinner in real estate. And if you follow up the way we show you, ROI isn’t a possibility — it’s inevitable. The only way you don’t win is if you quit. Let’s stop worrying about losing $300 and focus on how fast we can turn it into $10K.”",
I can’t afford to switch brokerages right now.,"“That’s exactly why you can’t afford to stay. If your current brokerage hasn’t given you the freedom to make this decision, it’s already costing you money. The best time to change is when you feel the squeeze. The worst mistake is waiting another year in the same spot.”",
I don’t want to split revenue share with anyone.,"“Revenue share is found money. Would you rather have 100% of nothing, or a percentage of passive income that pays every month? It’s like a royalty check — if you don’t want them, I’ll take yours.”",
I’m worried about losing income during the transition.,"“Every agent has had that fear, and every one of them says later, ‘I wish I’d done it sooner.’ The transition isn’t downtime — it’s plug-and-play. You keep selling while we build the machine. No lost income, only gained leverage.”",
I already have a system that works; why pay more?,"“Great. That means you know the value of a system. Now imagine keeping yours AND adding ours — doubling your results. The question isn’t ‘why pay more,’ it’s ‘why limit yourself?’ Champions stack advantages.”",
I don’t believe Facebook ads will generate quality leads in my market.,"“Do you believe in data? We’ve run these campaigns in over 50 markets — from Dallas to tiny towns — and the numbers don’t lie: $3–$5 leads, 75–100 a month. If it works in Canada, Puerto Rico, and rural areas, it’ll work in yours. The only question is whether your name is on the ad or your competitor’s.”",
Zillow/Realtor.com leads are expensive but at least predictable.,"“Predictable robbery isn’t a win. Zillow sells the same leads to your competition at 3–4X the cost. With us, you own the pipeline and you’re the only one touching your leads. Would you rather rent overpriced, recycled names, or own your own?”",
I don’t want another monthly subscription.,“Subscriptions drain you when they don’t produce. This isn’t Netflix — it’s a business multiplier. Every dollar in pays back tenfold. Would you cancel a subscription that puts clients on your calendar every week?”,
Online leads are garbage and never convert.,"“Garbage in, garbage out. Bad systems produce bad leads. Our campaigns target buyers and sellers already in motion — relocation, new construction, move-ups. With our scripts, 1 in 20 turns into a deal. If online leads never converted, no one would be selling houses.”",
I don’t want to chase cold internet leads.,"“Neither do I. That’s why we built the system so you don’t chase — you attract. When someone clicks a new construction ad, they’re raising their hand. That’s not cold; that’s warm. You just need to answer the phone.”",
I’ve tried Facebook ads before and they didn’t work.,"“I believe you. But ads don’t fail, strategies do. If you’ve never been taught direct response marketing, you’re throwing darts blindfolded. We’ve tested millions of dollars. We know what headlines, hooks, and offers work. You don’t have to guess anymore.”",
I don’t have time to follow up quickly on leads.,"“And that’s exactly why you need automation. Our system calls, texts, and emails the second a lead comes in, so you’re only picking up when someone’s engaged. Time isn’t your enemy — it’s how you leverage it.”",
Automation feels impersonal.,"“It’s not about robots replacing you. It’s about robots opening the door so you can walk in. Would you rather lose a lead because you couldn’t call in five minutes, or have automation buy you that chance?”",
I don’t believe you can actually deliver $3–$5 leads.,"“Fair doubt. That’s why we show live accounts, not theory. Agents in Amarillo, Ohio, Puerto Rico — all closing $300 leads into $10K commissions. Don’t believe me — believe the bank deposits.”",
My market is too competitive for Facebook ads.,"“Competition proves there’s money to be made. When everyone zigs, we zag — with niche ads that stand out. Builders, move-ups, geo-targets. The only agents who lose in competitive markets are the ones without a proven edge.”",
New construction ads won’t work in my area.,"“They said the same in Amarillo — until builders started calling our agents asking to list their communities. Every market has someone building, and buyers looking. If you don’t take that lane, your competitor will.”",
IDX lead capture never produces serious buyers.,"“IDX fails when you bait with fluff. We bait with urgency: just listed, just sold, builder incentives. That attracts people already shopping. IDX isn’t broken — it just needs the right hook. We give you that.”",
Builders already have their own agents; why would they work with me?,"“Because builders care about one thing — moving inventory. When your ads drive traffic they can’t get themselves, they see you as an asset, not a threat. We’ve had builders hand over listings just for running our ads. Would you like to be the agent they call, or watch someone else get the call?”",
I’m not tech-savvy.,"“That’s why we built this so you don’t have to be. You don’t need to know how to build the car — you just need to know how to drive it. We give you the keys, we fuel it, and we even set the GPS. Can you answer the phone? Then you can run this system.”",
I get overwhelmed with CRMs and funnels.,"“Of course you do — they’re built to confuse you so you stay stuck. We simplified it to one dashboard, one login, one system. No overwhelm. Just appointments showing up. Would it help if the tech stress disappeared?”",
I don’t want to learn another platform.,"“You don’t have to. We do the learning, setup, and running. You get the benefit. It’s like hiring a pilot — you don’t go to flight school, you just get to the destination.”",
Automation is too complicated.,"“It is if you try to build it yourself. But when it’s done for you, automation is just leverage. Think of it like power steering — complicated under the hood, simple behind the wheel.”",
I don’t trust AI follow-up.,"“AI isn’t here to replace you. It’s here to open the door so you can walk in. It never gets tired, never forgets, and always calls in five minutes. It just sets you up to be the hero in the conversation.”",
I don’t want to be stuck in ‘tech training’ instead of selling.,“Neither do I. That’s why we handle the tech while you stay face-to-face with clients. Our training is about what to say when the phone rings — not coding funnels. Wouldn’t you rather sell than troubleshoot?”,
Tech changes too fast; I’ll get left behind.,"“That’s exactly why you need us. We absorb the changes so you don’t have to. Every time Facebook or Google updates, we adjust — and you just keep getting leads. You’ll never fall behind because we’re already ahead.”",
I’ve had bad experiences with tech vendors.,"“So have I. Most of them overpromise and underdeliver. We’re different because we eat our own cooking — these are the exact funnels we use to sell and recruit. We’re not selling theory, we’re sharing what’s already working.”",
I don’t want my clients spammed with automation.,"“Neither do we. Spam pushes people away. Our system engages with value — listings, incentives, real offers. That’s why our follow-up gets replies instead of complaints. Would you agree trust beats spam?”",
I’d rather just cold call.,“That’s fine — but let’s be real. Do you want to chase or attract? Cold calling is rejection by design. Marketing is attraction by design. The top producers don’t choose between them — they stack them.”,
I don’t want to switch brokerages.,"“Nobody loves change. But growth requires it. If staying put was enough, you wouldn’t even be looking at this. The fact you’re here proves you’re searching. Don’t let comfort cost you opportunity.”",
I’m loyal to my current broker.,"“I respect loyalty. But loyalty without growth is slavery. A broker who really supports you would want you to build wealth, not just closings. Loyalty to family is noble. Loyalty to someone capping your potential is costly.”",
I don’t want to burn bridges with my current team.,"“You don’t burn bridges by growing. You simply outgrow them. And guess what? When they see you thriving, many of them will follow. You’re not abandoning anyone — you’re leading the way.”",
eXp feels like MLM/recruiting-focused.,"“That’s the lazy label people use when they don’t understand. eXp is a brokerage first — cloud-based, low overhead, huge value. Revenue share is simply a bonus stream, like a royalty. If you don’t want to recruit, don’t — you’ll still win.”",
I don’t want to be pressured to recruit agents.,"“Good. Don’t recruit. Nobody’s forcing you. Focus on selling — our system makes that easier. Recruiting is an optional wealth path, not a requirement.”",
I’m comfortable at a boutique brokerage.,"“Comfort is the enemy of growth. A boutique may feel cozy, but does it give you stock, revenue share, and a $50K/month marketing team? Or just comfort? You can have both culture AND scale at eXp.”",
I like the culture where I’m at.,"“Culture is great, but culture doesn’t pay the bills. eXp has culture, too — just global, connected, and collaborative. You can love your friends at your old office — and love your bank account here.”",
My broker gives me good splits already.,"“Splits are short-term. Wealth is long-term. Even at a good split, you’re capped by hours in the day. With stock and revenue share, you earn beyond closings. Would you rather save a few percent today, or build real wealth for tomorrow?”",
I don’t want to lose local office support.,"“Fair. But local offices are a crutch. The truth is, your business happens on your phone and laptop. We plug you into a national network of top producers who’ll out-support any brick-and-mortar.”",
I don’t see the value of eXp stock options.,“Then you haven’t looked closely. Agents have built six- and seven-figure retirement accounts simply by doing what they’re already doing — closing deals. Stock is free ownership. Why say no to free equity?”,
I don’t have time to learn a new system.,"“Exactly — and that’s why this works. You don’t need to learn it, we build and run it for you. Your only job? Answer the phone. If you have time to take a call, you have time for this.”",
I don’t want to attend more training sessions.,“Neither do I. This isn’t about packing your calendar with classes. It’s about results. We coach you on what matters — converting leads into closings. Would you agree one hour of training is worth it if it adds $10K to your month?”,
I’m too busy with current clients.,“That’s a blessing — but also the trap. Busyness without systems = burnout. The right system gives you consistency without chaos. Wouldn’t you like to stay busy while also building a predictable pipeline?”,
I don’t want to overhaul my whole business.,"“Good news: you don’t have to. We layer our system on top of what you already do. No overhaul, just acceleration. Think of it like adding a turbocharger to the engine you already drive.”",
I’m close to retiring; not worth switching now.,“That’s exactly why it matters. eXp offers stock and revenue share — assets that outlive your production. Retiring without passive income means you stop earning when you stop working. Wouldn’t you like your business to pay you after you hang up your license?”,
I just don’t want to change.,"“Nobody does. But change is where growth lives. If you never changed, you’d still be using a flip phone. The only question is — do you want to cling to comfort, or step into opportunity?”",
I don’t want to build a team.,“Perfect. You don’t need to. This system builds your client base whether you have one agent or fifty. Team building is optional. Closings are guaranteed if you work the process.”,
I like doing things the ‘old school’ way.,“Old school hustle works — until you want freedom. The classics like J. Douglas Edwards and Tom Hopkins would tell you: evolve or die. ‘Old school’ plus modern marketing is unstoppable. Why not have both?”,
My schedule is already overloaded.,“That’s why leverage exists. Imagine your calendar with fewer dead-end activities and more appointments with ready-to-act clients. We don’t add work — we replace busywork with profit work.”,
I don’t want to sit in front of a computer.,"“Then don’t. Our team sits behind the screen so you can stay face-to-face with people. The computer runs the system, you reap the results.”",
This sounds too good to be true.,“Fair. But too good to be true usually means you haven’t seen it yet. We’re not pitching hype — we’re showing documented case studies. Good to be true is exactly what happens when a proven system meets execution.”,
Why would you give away a $50K/month marketing team for free?,"“Because we get paid through eXp’s model. Revenue share allows us to build this team without charging you. You win with leads, we win with growth. It’s not charity — it’s alignment.”",
What’s the catch?,"“The catch is simple: you’ve got to do the work. Answer the phone, follow the script, and close deals. There’s no hidden fee, no bait-and-switch. The catch is commitment.”",
I don’t trust coaches who promise leads.,"“Neither do I. Most coaches sell theory. We don’t teach you to fish — we drop the fish in your boat. This isn’t coaching, it’s implementation.”",
I’ve been burned by ‘gurus’ before.,"“So have I. The difference is, gurus sell you information. We give you a done-for-you machine. You’re not buying a dream, you’re plugging into a proven engine.”",
Everyone says they have the ‘best system.’,"“And most of them can’t prove it. We don’t claim — we demonstrate. Real agents in real markets showing closings within 30–60 days. Results aren’t opinions, they’re math.”",
I’m skeptical about testimonials.,“Good. Skepticism is healthy. But skepticism without investigation is just fear. Don’t believe the testimonial — believe your own results when you test it for 30 days.”,
Are these success stories real?,"“Yes — and verifiable. You can talk to agents who’ve done it, not just read about them. If you want, I’ll connect you to one. They’ll tell you the same thing: this works.”",
Why are you doing this if you’re already making millions?,"“Because once you reach financial freedom, the game becomes significance. Helping other agents win is how I win bigger. eXp lets me scale my impact and my income at the same time.”",
I don’t want to be someone’s guinea pig.,"“Good news: you’re not. We’ve already tested, tweaked, and proven this in dozens of markets. You’re not the guinea pig — you’re the beneficiary.”",
My market is too small.,"“That’s an advantage. In small markets, you dominate faster. Ads stand out more, cost less, and people recognize your face sooner. Would you rather fight for scraps in a big pond or own the small pond?”",
My market is too rural for Facebook ads.,"“Rural doesn’t mean invisible. People in rural areas still scroll Facebook every night. They buy, sell, and move too. If anything, fewer agents are running ads there — meaning you win easier.”",
My market is luxury-focused; these leads won’t work.,"“Luxury buyers and sellers are on Facebook too — they just want a different message. We tailor the hook to the market. If it can sell $500K homes, it can sell $5M estates with the right positioning.”",
My market is declining; nobody’s buying.,"“Markets don’t die, they shift. When buyers slow, sellers get motivated. The question isn’t if deals are happening — it’s who’s getting them. Would you rather sit on the sidelines or scoop up market share while others quit?”",
Inventory is too low for this to work.,"“Low inventory means demand is sky-high. Our ads pull buyers looking and sellers curious about value. In low inventory markets, even one listing lead can turn into multiple transactions.”",
Rates are too high right now.,"“Exactly. That’s why buyers and sellers need guidance more than ever. We don’t wait for perfect markets — we win in every market. If you can thrive when rates are high, you’ll own the field when they drop.”",
Buyers are sitting on the fence.,“And that’s exactly why you need a system. Fence-sitters need confidence. Our scripts give you the words to move them off the fence. Someone’s going to help them decide — why not you?”,
Sellers aren’t listing.,“Not true. Sellers are still listing — just more carefully. The difference is being in front of them when they do. Our campaigns put you in that conversation first.”,
Builders aren’t offering incentives in my area.,"“That’s temporary. Incentives shift month to month. The point isn’t the incentive — it’s the positioning. Even without specials, new construction is one of the easiest hooks to generate ready buyers.”",
My competition already dominates ads here.,"“Perfect. That means the model is proven. If they’re spending money, they’re making money. We don’t reinvent the wheel — we give you a sharper edge so you cut right into their market share.”",
I don’t want to lose my brand.,"“You won’t. We build around your brand. eXp isn’t about erasing you — it’s about amplifying you. Your name, your face, your business — just with more firepower behind it.”",
I don’t want to change email/CRM/website.,"“You don’t have to. Keep what you like, we’ll connect the rest. This isn’t about forcing tools — it’s about making the tools you already have actually work.”",
I don’t like change in general.,"“Nobody does. But nothing grows without it. Comfort zones feel safe, but they kill dreams. Growth lives just outside that line. The question is — are you willing to grow?”",
I don’t want to feel like a beginner again.,"“You won’t. We don’t strip you down — we add on. You’re not starting over, you’re leveling up. Beginners guess. You’ll be executing proven strategies day one.”",
I’ve already invested in my own systems.,"“Great — then you know the value of systems. But let me ask: are they producing 75–100 leads a month for $300? If not, our system pays for itself the first deal. You’re not replacing your investment — you’re multiplying it.”",
I don’t want to confuse my clients.,"“Clients don’t care what brokerage you’re under — they care if you solve their problem. If anything, they’ll respect you more for upgrading your business. Confusion disappears when results speak louder.”",
I don’t want to move brokerages mid-year.,"“The calendar doesn’t care. Opportunity doesn’t wait for January 1st. Whether it’s March, July, or December, one good month here changes the whole year. Why delay momentum?”",
I don’t want to deal with switching MLS/boards.,"“It feels like a hassle, but it’s a one-time paperwork shuffle. Compare that to years of missed opportunity. Would you let one form stand between you and financial freedom?”",
I don’t want to risk losing deals in progress.,“You won’t. Deals in progress stay under your current brokerage until they close. You transition clean. You don’t stop making money while you switch — you simply start making more after.”,
My spouse/partner won’t support a switch.,"“Fair. But spouses support results. When they see the income, equity, and freedom this creates, resistance turns into support. The fastest way to win them over is to show them the numbers.”",
I’m not good at sales.,"“Neither was anyone at first. Sales is a skill, not a gene. We hand you scripts that work — proven words from the greatest closers in history. You don’t need to be slick; you just need to follow the playbook.”",
I don’t like making calls.,“That’s why this system works. The automation warms them up so you’re not cold-calling strangers — you’re returning calls to people who already raised their hand. Big difference.”,
I don’t want to sound pushy.,"“Pushy is trying to convince someone who isn’t interested. Our system finds people already looking. You’re not pushing, you’re guiding. There’s a world of difference.”",
I’m too introverted.,"“Introverts win here because they listen better. You don’t have to be loud, you just have to be consistent. The system does the heavy lifting — you just connect authentically.”",
I’m not consistent enough to follow up.,"“That’s why automation exists. It follows up 24/7 whether you do or not. Consistency is built into the system, so your only job is to show up when they respond.”",
I’ve tried so many things; nothing works.,"“And that’s exactly why you should try something proven. This isn’t another shiny object — it’s a system built on direct response principles older than both of us. If you can follow a recipe, this will work.”",
I don’t believe I can succeed in real estate long term.,"“That’s just fear talking. If others can succeed, so can you. The only difference is having the right system and mentorship. This gives you both. Borrow our belief until you build your own.”",
I don’t want to embarrass myself if I fail.,"“Failure isn’t embarrassing — quitting is. Everyone stumbles. The difference is we stumble forward with a team behind us. With support like this, failure turns into feedback.”",
I don’t want to commit to something new and quit later.,"“That’s why we set this up to win early. First leads in 30 days, first deal in 60. Early success builds momentum. You won’t want to quit when the pipeline starts flowing.”",
I’m not ready for that level of growth.,“Growth doesn’t ask if you’re ready. It shows up when opportunity does. Nobody ever feels ready — they just decide. Would you rather ease into success or stay stuck waiting?”,
I don’t want to manage agents.,"“Then don’t. Revenue share is optional. Focus on selling and use the system to double your closings. If you ever want to lead a team later, the door’s open.”",
I don’t want to recruit anyone.,“Perfect. Recruiting isn’t required. You’ll win just by selling more. The revenue share is just bonus fuel if you choose to use it.”,
Revenue share sounds like a pyramid scheme.,"“That’s the easy excuse people throw around when they don’t understand. Pyramids take without giving. Revenue share pays you for value created — just like royalties, franchises, or profit share. It’s business, not a scheme.”",
"I just want to sell houses, not build a team.",“Great — then let’s help you sell more houses. The team-building side is optional. You’ll already win with closings; the extra income stream is there if you ever want it.”,
I don’t believe passive income is realistic.,“Then look around. Thousands of eXp agents are living off revenue share checks right now. It’s as real as rental income — except you don’t need to own a single property to earn it.”,
Recruiting will distract me from clients.,"“Not if you don’t want it to. Focus on clients. If someone asks about your success, share the story. That’s all recruiting is — telling your truth. No distraction required.”",
I don’t know any agents I could bring over.,"“That’s fine. Start with zero, focus on closings. Over time, agents will ask how you’re winning. Sharing your story is the natural magnet — you don’t need a Rolodex to attract.”",
I don’t want to pressure my friends.,"“And you shouldn’t. Pressure pushes people away. Attraction pulls them in. When your results speak for themselves, friends will ask you — no pressure necessary.”",
I don’t want to compete with other recruiters at eXp.,"“You’re not competing. You’re collaborating. eXp’s model rewards teamwork, not turf wars. When we grow together, everyone wins.”",
I don’t want to be ‘sold’ on recruiting as the main benefit.,"“Good — because the main benefit is closings. Recruiting is the cherry on top. The core value is more deals, more income, more freedom. Everything else is optional.”",
"How many leads can I expect, and what’s the typical cost per lead?","“We’re not talking theory here. You’ll see 75–100 leads a month for about $300 — $3–$5 a lead. Now, not every lead buys today, but if you work the scripts, one deal pays for the entire year. That’s the kind of math top producers love — tiny inputs, massive outputs.”","leads, cost per lead, ROI"
Are leads exclusive to me once I’m in?,"“Yes — 100%. The ads run in your account, not mine, not Zillow’s. They’re your pipeline, your leads, forever. And here’s the warning: don’t shut them off. The only agents who lose are the ones who kill their own machine.”","exclusivity, ownership, pipeline"
Do I have to join eXp to access this system?,"“You could stroke a $15K check and I’ll do it for you. But why would I take your money when I’d rather help you for free? At eXp, the company compensates me, not you. That way you keep your capital and get the machine.”","eXp requirement, cost, partnership"
How are the eXp fees and splits structured?,"“Simple: 80/20 split, $16K cap. After that, you’re at 100% minus a tiny transaction fee. Do 20 more deals? You ICON and get the $16K back in stock. Translation? You’re effectively at 100% and building wealth.”","fees, splits, cap, ICON"
How does this cost-per-lead compare to Zillow or other vendors?,“Zillow sells you the same lead three times over at $100+. We give you your own exclusive lead factory at $3–$5. Do you want to rent recycled names or own the pipeline forever?”,"Zillow, competitors, cost comparison"
What’s the $25 transaction fee?,"“It’s peanuts. Before you cap, it’s $25 per deal. After you cap, it’s $250 until you hit ICON and get your $16K back in stock. Most agents blow that on Starbucks in a week. Don’t let coffee money scare you from wealth.”","fees, transaction fee, cost"
What does the $16K cap mean?,"“It means freedom. Once eXp collects $16K, you’re at 100% commission. Do enough production, hit ICON, and they give it right back to you in stock. So you’re not losing — you’re investing in yourself.”","cap, ICON, wealth building"
How long does it take to get the funnel live?,"“About 10–14 days. We verify your number, build the ads, load the CRM, flip the switch. You’ll have leads coming in before most agents even get their business cards back from the printer.”","funnel setup, timeline"
When will I start closing deals?,"“Leads flow fast, closings take 60–90 days. Buyers need nurturing. The key is consistency. The only agents who don’t close are the ones who quit before the pipeline matures.”","closing timeline, lead nurturing"
How is your program different from eXp corporate leads?,"“This isn’t a corporate pond where you’re fighting over scraps. This is your pond, in your account, with your ads. Nobody else touches your fish but you.”","corporate leads, exclusivity"
How is this different from other pay-per-click vendors?,"“Vendors spray and pray. We laser in with AI, data, and tested copy. We track every click, every cost. If costs rise, we pivot instantly. Vendors sell you clicks. We build you closings.”","PPC, competitors, AI marketing"
Who handles the ads and creative?,"“We do. My marketing team writes the ads, builds the funnels, launches the campaigns. You just approve and answer the phone. You’re the agent, not the ad guy.”","ads, creative, done-for-you"
Do I need kvCORE to use this?,"“We prefer kvCORE because it’s seamless. But if you’re on Lofty or BoldTrail, we can plug in too. The key is automation — kvCORE just makes it smooth.”","kvCORE, CRM, integration"
What if I don’t have kvCORE?,“No problem. We’ll get you a seat or work with what you’ve got. Tools shouldn’t hold you back — we adapt the system around you.”,"kvCORE, CRM, alternatives"
What if I’m not tech-savvy?,"“Perfect. The less techy you are, the better. My team does it all — domain, CRM, automation, A2P compliance. Your job is to pick up the phone when it rings. Can you do that?”","tech skills, simplicity, automation"
What if I don’t want to be on camera for videos?,"“You don’t have to. We’ve built ad templates, graphics, and copy that run without your face. But here’s the truth: the agents who win big step into the spotlight. Don’t worry — we’ll coach you through it until you’re comfortable.”","video, marketing, comfort"
Can I run this system in my market if it’s saturated?,"“Markets don’t saturate — agents do. Zillow spends billions because there’s always room for another player who’s consistent. You don’t need 100% of the market, just your slice. One steady pipeline makes you the authority.”","saturation, market, competition"
How do you handle compliance with real estate advertising rules?,"“We’ve run thousands of campaigns nationwide. Every ad goes through compliance filters, state disclaimers, brokerage disclosures. We know the rules inside and out — and we keep you safe.”","compliance, ads, legal"
What if Facebook bans my account?,"“We build the campaigns in your Business Manager with proper setup and warmup. If you ever get flagged, we handle appeals. Bottom line — we’ve been through it all and know how to keep you live.”","Facebook, bans, ads"
How do I get trained on following up with leads?,"“We don’t just throw you leads and say good luck. You’ll get scripts, call recordings, objection handlers — the same stuff we used to build million-dollar teams. You’ll know exactly what to say from day one.”","training, scripts, follow-up"
What makes these leads different from Realtor.com or Opcity leads?,"“Realtor.com sells you a name. Opcity takes a referral fee on the back end. Our system gives you the lead directly, in your database, forever. No referral tax. No middleman.”","Realtor.com, Opcity, lead source"
How do you avoid bad quality leads?,"“Quality comes from targeting and copy. We dial both in so you’re talking to real buyers and sellers, not tire-kickers. But remember — fortune is in the follow-up. Even a ‘bad’ lead today can be a closing tomorrow.”","lead quality, targeting, follow-up"
What if I already have too many leads?,"“Too many leads isn’t a problem — it’s an opportunity. The problem is not enough systems. We help you filter, sort, and automate so only the hottest prospects hit your phone.”","too many leads, systems, automation"
How do I scale this up if I want more?,"“Easy. Once the funnel works at $300, you just turn the dial — $600, $900, $1,200. Same system, more fuel, bigger fire. You’re in control of your pipeline.”","scaling, budget, growth"
What if I can’t afford $300 a month right now?,"“If you don’t have $300 to invest in your business, you don’t have a business — you have a hobby. One deal pays for years of ads. Winners think ROI, not cost.”","affordability, investment, mindset"
What happens if I leave eXp later?,"“The machine we build is in your account. You keep the ads, the CRM, the automation. You lose nothing — except the stock and revenue share you’d be compounding if you stayed.”","leaving eXp, ownership, retention"
How is this system different from hiring an ISA?,"“An ISA costs you $2,000 a month plus training. Our system brings the leads to you for a fraction of that. And when you’re ready for an ISA, we’ll help you train them on our scripts.”","ISA, cost, leverage"
What’s the catch?,"“The catch is you’ve got to work. We can hand you the machine, the leads, the scripts, but if you don’t pick up the phone, it won’t print closings. The good news? If you do, it’s unstoppable.”","skepticism, catch, mindset"
Do I have to change my CRM if I already use one?,"“Not at all. We love kvCORE, but we can plug into Follow Up Boss, LionDesk, Lofty — you name it. The tool doesn’t matter, the system does.”","CRM, integration, flexibility"
How do I know this will work in my city?,"“Real estate is the same everywhere: people buy, people sell, people move. We’ve launched in tiny towns and mega metros, always the same outcome — leads flow. Your consistency is what creates closings.”","city, geography, results"
What if I’m not tech-savvy?,"“That’s the best part. We’ve built it to be plug-and-play. If you can open your email, you can run this system. And if you ever get stuck, our team walks you through every step.”","tech, simplicity, support"
How do I stand out if everyone has the same system?,"“The system is the engine. Your brand, your voice, your follow-up — that’s the difference. Think of it like a Ferrari: just because someone else owns one doesn’t mean they’ll drive it like you.”","differentiation, branding, competition"
"Can this help me with listings, not just buyers?","“Absolutely. We use targeted seller ads, free home valuation funnels, and market update campaigns. Some agents run 60% listings through this system alone.”","listings, sellers, ads"
Will I have to cold call strangers?,"“No. These aren’t random phone book names — they’re people who raised their hand online. You’re not interrupting, you’re responding. That’s a world of difference.”","cold calling, leads, outreach"
What about the learning curve?,"“Every new skill feels uphill at first. But we flatten the curve with training, templates, and scripts. You’ll be making calls with confidence in days, not months.”","learning curve, training, speed"
What happens if my ads don’t work?,"“Ads always work — if the formula’s right. We’ve already cracked that code. If something flops, we test, tweak, and relaunch until it clicks. Failure isn’t an option when you’ve got pros in your corner.”","ads, performance, troubleshooting"
Do I need to hire an assistant first?,"“No. The system itself acts like a digital assistant. It tags, sorts, and nurtures for you. You only talk to warm prospects. When you do hire, we’ll help train them on this foundation.”","assistant, leverage, automation"
Can I run this part-time?,"“Yes — but know this: the system rewards the effort you put in. Even part-time agents can close 1–2 deals a month. Just be consistent, and the results compound.”","part-time, effort, consistency"
What if I’m already happy where I am?,"“Happiness is good, but wealth is better. If your current setup doesn’t give you ownership, stock, and passive income, you’re leaving money on the table. Why settle when you can have both?”","contentment, motivation, wealth"
How do I know this isn’t just hype?,"“We’ve put real numbers, real names, and real results on the table. No smoke, no mirrors. Talk to agents who’ve done it — they’ll tell you exactly what this has created for them.”","skepticism, proof, trust"
Will this distract me from serving my clients?,"“Not at all. In fact, it saves time. Instead of chasing random opportunities, you’re only working real conversations. That means more time serving clients who matter.”","distraction, service, focus"
What if I’m brand new and don’t know what to say?,"“Perfect. A new agent with the right scripts is more powerful than a veteran with no system. We hand you the words, the timing, the cadence. You’ll sound like a pro from your very first call.”","new agent, scripts, confidence"
I don’t want to feel ‘salesy.’,"“Salesy happens when you push. We teach you to ask questions, uncover needs, and solve problems. That’s not sales — that’s service. And people love to buy from those who serve.”","salesy, mindset, service"
Can I use this system in luxury real estate?,"“Luxury clients live online too. We’ve run funnels for $2M+ listings that filled open houses. High-ticket clients want certainty, and this system gives you exactly that.”","luxury, listings, niche"
What if my broker doesn’t support this?,"“That’s why you partner with us. We give you what most brokers never will — leads, systems, support, and ownership. If they can’t match that, why stay tied down?”","broker support, partnership, independence"
I don’t want to split commissions.,"“Think about it — would you rather keep 100% of a small pie, or 80% of a pie that’s 10x bigger? This system grows your pie. Net income beats gross ego every time.”","commission split, income, perspective"
My team won’t want to move.,"“Leaders lead. When you show your team the ownership, stock, and revenue share potential, they’ll thank you for elevating them. If they’re loyal, they’ll follow the opportunity.”","team, leadership, loyalty"
I’m worried about switching MLS or tech systems.,"“That’s like fearing a new iPhone update. You adapt once, and then you never look back. Plus, we walk you through every step so there’s zero downtime.”","MLS, tech, transition"
My reputation is tied to my current brokerage.,"“Your reputation is you — not your logo. Clients hire you, not your broker’s brand. And when they see you leveling up, they’ll respect you even more.”","reputation, brand, independence"
Isn’t eXp too new to trust?,"“eXp is publicly traded on the Nasdaq, debt-free, and the fastest-growing brokerage in history. That’s not new — that’s proven momentum you can bank on.”","eXp, credibility, growth"
What if the housing market crashes?,"“Markets shift, but people always buy and sell. The agents with pipelines, systems, and leverage survive and thrive. This isn’t about market timing — it’s about market proofing.”","market crash, resilience, security"
I don’t like recruiting.,"“Good. Neither do most of us. But attracting agents isn’t about pitching — it’s about showing results. When others see your success, they ask how. That’s attraction, not recruiting.”","recruiting, attraction, mindset"
"I’ve tried lead gen before, and it didn’t work.","“That’s because you didn’t have the right formula. We’re not guessing — we’ve cracked the code with proven funnels. The difference is, now you’ve got experts backing you.”","lead gen, past failure, credibility"
I don’t want to chase cold internet leads.,"“Neither do we. These are real people opting in with intent. With proper follow-up, they become warm quickly. The internet is just the introduction — the relationship is built by you.”","cold leads, internet, relationships"
Will I have to spend all day on the phone?,“No — because we teach leverage. A few focused hours calling warm leads beats 10 hours of random grind. The system makes your calls count.”,"phone calls, time, leverage"
I’m worried about hidden costs.,"“There’s nothing hidden. Ads, tools, and training are laid out upfront. The only surprise you’ll get is how much extra income shows up when you run it right.”","hidden costs, transparency, money"
I don’t want to be tied to one way of doing business.,"“This isn’t about boxing you in. It’s about giving you the foundation. Once you’ve got leads flowing, you can expand in any direction you want — listings, luxury, team building.”","flexibility, business model, growth"
What if my clients get confused about the switch?,"“They won’t. Clients care about you, not your broker’s logo. In fact, you’ll wow them with more resources, better support, and a stronger presence.”","clients, transition, clarity"
I’m too busy already.,“Exactly why you need this. Busy without leverage is burnout. Busy with leverage is scale. This system buys you time while multiplying your results.”,"busy, time, leverage"
Will I lose my downline or past work?,"“No — anything you’ve built stays with you. And what you add here compounds with ownership, stock, and revenue share. You’re not losing; you’re stacking.”","downline, retention, growth"
I don’t like change.,"“Most people don’t — but growth lives on the other side of change. Staying the same is more painful than adapting, because the market won’t wait for you.”","change, growth, mindset"
My broker has been good to me.,"“Loyalty is honorable — but your broker won’t retire you. Revenue share, stock, and leverage will. You can stay loyal to your broker, or loyal to your family’s future.”","loyalty, broker, future"
I’m already hitting my goals.,“That’s the danger zone. Comfort kills growth. The question isn’t can you hit today’s goals — it’s can you create freedom for tomorrow. That takes more.”,"goals, comfort, growth"
I’m worried about my sphere not following me.,"“Your sphere follows you, not your office. If anything, moving shows leadership. People trust leaders who take bold steps.”","sphere, leadership, clients"
I don’t want to learn a new CRM.,"“Our CRM is plug-and-play. Plus, once you see the automation, you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it. It’s not learning — it’s unchaining yourself.”","CRM, tech, simplicity"
My current split isn’t bad.,“A good split is fine — but ownership and revenue share beat splits every time. You can’t out-split equity and passive income.”,"split, commissions, ownership"
I’m planning to retire soon.,"“Perfect. That’s exactly why you need this. Passive income, equity, and attraction build a retirement pipeline your broker can’t give you.”","retirement, passive income, future"
I don’t want to recruit friends.,"“You don’t have to. Just share your results. The right people will lean in, and the wrong people will filter themselves out. It’s attraction, not arm-twisting.”","recruiting, attraction, friends"
My area is saturated.,“Saturation is a myth. There are always deals. The agents who stand out with systems and leverage win — no matter how crowded the market looks.”,"saturation, competition, mindset"
I don’t want to pay monthly fees.,"“Our monthly is less than the cost of one lunch a day — and it comes with ownership, stock, and proven systems. That’s not a fee, it’s an investment.”","fees, cost, investment"
"My clients are luxury, and I’m not sure eXp fits.",“eXp has some of the top luxury agents in the country. Brand is what you build — and you’ll have more resources to amplify your luxury presence here.”,"luxury, brand, clients"
I’ve been burned by promises before.,"“Understandable — but this isn’t theory. This is documented, duplicated, and proven. We don’t promise; we produce.”","promises, trust, credibility"
My spouse isn’t on board.,"“That’s why we invite spouses to see it. When they understand the freedom and security this creates, they often become your biggest supporter.”","spouse, family, buy-in"
I don’t want to lose my independence.,"“You’re not losing it — you’re multiplying it. Independence with ownership, revenue share, and stock beats independence with no exit plan.”","independence, freedom, ownership"
What if this doesn’t work for me?,"“The only way it doesn’t work is if you don’t work it. The system is proven. If you plug in and execute, the results follow. Period.”","doubt, execution, proof"
I don’t want to feel pressured to hit attraction numbers.,"“There are no quotas here. You’re free to attract or not. But the beauty is, if you simply share your success, the numbers take care of themselves.”","attraction, pressure, freedom"
My production will drop if I focus on this.,"“Your production grows because of this — more leverage, more systems, more focus. This isn’t distraction, it’s multiplication.”","production, leverage, growth"
My market doesn’t know eXp.,“That’s the opportunity. You get to plant the flag and become the local pioneer. First movers always win bigger.”,"market, pioneer, opportunity"
I don’t want to lose my current mentor.,"“Keep them. eXp adds to your circle, it doesn’t subtract. And here, your mentorship grows with world-class partners who’ve built what you want.”","mentor, leadership, support"
My team is too small to benefit.,“Teams of 1 or 100 benefit — the difference is scale. Even solo agents build passive income here. Small just means you’ll grow faster.”,"teams, scale, solo agents"
I don’t want to be part of a ‘pyramid.’,"“This isn’t a pyramid. It’s a brokerage with revenue share. Every company has hierarchy — here, you finally get paid for it.”","pyramid, structure, credibility"
I don’t want to leave my office culture.,“Culture isn’t walls — it’s people. You can keep your relationships and add a global network of high-performers you’d never meet otherwise.”,"culture, relationships, network"
I don’t trust virtual brokerages.,"“The world is virtual now. Banking, shopping, learning. Why not real estate? And the virtual model frees up millions for agents instead of brick and mortar.”","virtual, model, trust"
My broker promised me leadership roles.,“Titles don’t build wealth. Ownership and revenue share do. You can have a title — or you can have freedom.”,"leadership, titles, wealth"
I don’t want to start over.,"“You’re not starting over — you’re stacking on top. Your deals, your clients, your brand stay intact. You’re just adding more streams to it.”","start over, brand, clients"
My local board won’t like eXp.,“Boards don’t like disruption. That’s normal. But they can’t stop progress. Every board that resisted eventually had to accept innovation.”,"board, disruption, progress"
I don’t want to spend time on tech.,"“Our tech is built to save you time, not steal it. Once it’s set, it runs in the background like an assistant who never sleeps.”","tech, time, automation"
My identity is tied to my current brokerage brand.,"“Your brand is you, not your broker. The best agents are known for their name, not the logo on their card. Here, you own your identity.”","brand, identity, independence"
I’m afraid of losing referrals from my current network.,"“Referrals are built on trust in you. If anything, moving makes you more referable — because you’ll have stronger tools, support, and reach.”","referrals, trust, network"
This sounds too good to be true.,“That’s what every breakthrough sounds like at first. But we’re not asking you to believe words — just look at the results. Truth leaves clues.”,"belief, results, proof"
