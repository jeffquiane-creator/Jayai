I'm loyal to my broker.,"Respect that — loyalty’s a great trait. But loyalty should never cost you growth. If your broker truly supports you, they’d want you to explore what’s best for your business. We’re not asking for a commitment — just a conversation. Fair enough?",Loyalty / Comfort,"loyalty, comfort, resistance to change"
I don't want to lose my branding.,"Totally valid — and you won’t. At eXp, you keep full branding control. We’re here to amplify your brand, not replace it. In fact, our system helps your brand show up better, faster, and more consistently. Want to see how we make that happen?",Brand / Identity,"branding, reputation, control"
Is this just about recruiting?,"Nope. Our first goal is helping you close more deals — period. Most agents come for the production systems. If you want to grow a team later, cool — we’ve got the tools. But this starts with helping you sell more homes, not pitch more agents. Let’s start there, yeah?",Skepticism / Model Doubts,"skepticism, exp doubts, model concern"
I’m not tech-savvy.,"Perfect — you don’t have to be. That’s why we build everything for you. Our team sets up the systems, launches your ads, handles the tech — you just focus on talking to leads and closing deals. If we take care of the backend, could you handle the front-end?",Technology / Complexity,"technology, systems, overwhelm, tools"
I’ve heard eXp is too hands-off.,"I’ve heard that too — but here’s the truth: it depends on *who* you partner with. Most agents who say that didn’t have real support. Our team is built different — we onboard you, build with you, and stick with you. Want to see what that kind of support actually looks like?",Skepticism / Model Doubts,"skepticism, exp doubts, model concern"
I’m not ready to make a move yet.,"Totally fair — but here’s a question: what would need to be true for you to feel ready? Let’s get clear on that together, and whether now’s the time or not, you’ll at least know what’s possible. Cool if we walk through that real quick?",Timing / Readiness,"timing, readiness, hesitation"
How do I know this will actually work?,"Fair question — and the answer’s simple: results. We have the case studies, closings, and real agents to prove it. We’re not pitching potential — we’re delivering proven systems. Want me to show you a few examples so you can see for yourself?",General,"miscellaneous, general"
What if I don’t get any leads?,"We get it — that’s a real concern. That’s why we don’t just hand you tools and wish you luck. We run your ads, monitor performance, and optimize along the way. If we’re building and managing it for you, that changes the game. Want to see the exact setup we use?",Production / Lead Gen,"lead generation, production, closing, pipeline"
I’ve tried things like this before — they never work.,"Totally understand the skepticism. A lot of agents have been burned by broken promises. But this isn’t a course or coaching. We build real systems that produce real conversations and closings. What if this time, it wasn’t on you to figure it out?",General,"miscellaneous, general"
I’m a control freak — I like doing things my way.,"Love that. High standards mean high performance. The good news is — we don’t replace your way, we just amplify it. We build the engine. You drive the strategy. Would having a team execute your vision help you go faster?",General,"miscellaneous, general"
