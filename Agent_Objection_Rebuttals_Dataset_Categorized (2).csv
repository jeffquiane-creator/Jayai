I'm happy where I'm at.,"Totally get that — and honestly, if you're not feeling any pain, change feels unnecessary. But let me ask you: if you could get everything you're getting now, plus a team that builds and runs your entire system to help you close 2–3 more deals a month at no cost… why wouldn't you at least explore it? Let’s jump on a quick call so you can see the difference. Fair enough?",Loyalty / Comfort,"loyalty, comfort, resistance to change",,,,
,,,,jay_faqs_master,"How many leads can I expect, and what’s the typical cost per lead?",faqs/leads,"Great question. Quick version: our baseline target is ~75–100 leads a month on a $300 budget, which pencils out to about $3–$5 per lead. What partners find is that deals come from consistent follow‑up—only a fraction answer first call, so we work the 10‑day plan and long‑term nurture. Does that align with what you’re aiming for? Want to map your market and confirm expected volume?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Are leads exclusive to me once I’m in?,faqs/leads,"Yes. Ads run in your own Facebook/Meta account, so the leads are yours and flow straight into your CRM. You can turn budget up or down any time. I just don’t recommend shutting off completely—many agents get busy and accidentally kill their own pipeline. Make sense? Want me to show how we throttle instead of hard‑stop?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do I have to join eXp to access this system?,faqs/exp_model,"Partnering at eXp is how I do this for free—I’m compensated through revenue share, so you keep your cash for ads. If you insist on paying instead of moving, we can do an implementation (~$15k), but I’d rather just help you and keep your money working in your business. Fair enough? Should we look at the eXp path first and compare?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,How are the eXp fees and splits structured?,faqs/exp_model,"Simple: 80/20 split with a $16,000 cap. After you cap, you’re at 100% and pay a $250 transaction fee per closing until you’ve paid $5,000—at that point you hit ICON and receive the $16,000 back in company stock. Early on, expect a $25 transaction fee per closing. Sound reasonable?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,How does this cost‑per‑lead approach compare to buying leads from Zillow or other vendors?,faqs/leads,"We target $3–$5 CPL on campaigns you own, versus portal leads that can be $100+ and resold to multiple agents. Owning your funnel builds a compounding database and more conversations per dollar. Would it be a bad idea to start with a $10/day pilot and judge it by the data?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What’s the $25 transaction fee?,faqs/exp_model,"Before capping, there’s a $25 transaction fee per closing. After you cap, it’s $250 per closing until you’ve paid $5,000 in transaction fees—then you reach ICON and the $16,000 cap is returned in stock. Make sense so far?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,"What does the $16,000 cap mean?",faqs/exp_model,"You pay the 80/20 split until eXp collects $16,000 from your production. After that you’re effectively 100%, with a small transaction fee until ICON status. Clear enough?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,How long does it take to get the funnel live?,faqs/onboarding,"We move fast: A2P/phone registration is typically ~10 days, while creative, CRM automations, and compliance run in parallel. Most agents launch in about 2–3 weeks. Want to see the step‑by‑step timeline?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,When will I start closing deals?,faqs/time,Leads start almost immediately after launch; closings generally show up in 60–90 days as the pipeline compiles. Buyers often nurture for a few weeks before moving. Sound fair?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,How is your program different from eXp corporate leads?,faqs/leads,"This isn’t a corporate lead pond. We build a funnel in your ad account and your CRM. You control budget, messaging, and follow‑up; there’s no competition with other agents, and you own the data. Want a quick screen‑share of a live setup?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,How is this different from other pay‑per‑click vendors?,faqs/leads,"Market data + AI pick the right price points and angles per city, then we test multiple creatives and iterate quickly if CPL rises. It’s not ‘set and forget’—it’s test → measure → adjust. Does that approach fit how you like to operate?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Who handles the ads and creative?,faqs/onboarding,"My marketing team designs your ads, builds landing pages, and configures all the tech. You approve the assets and we launch. Easy enough?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do I need kvCORE to use this?,faqs/tools,kvCORE/BoldTrail gives the cleanest integration and is our default. We can also work with Lofty/Chime; kvCORE just plugs into more of our automations out of the box. Do you have a preference now?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What if I don’t have kvCORE?,faqs/tools,"We can migrate you onto kvCORE or work with Lofty/BoldTrail if you already have it. If your brokerage doesn’t offer kvCORE, you may need to purchase a seat. Want me to outline pros/cons for your setup?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What if I’m not tech‑savvy?,faqs/onboarding,"No problem—we do it with you. We’ll verify domains, configure automations, connect API Nation, register A2P, and push the campaigns live. Your focus is conversations and appointments. Make sense?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do I need to create my own ads or content?,faqs/tools,"No. We supply proven ads, images, and short‑form scripts. If you want to record local updates, we’ll script them—but it’s optional. Would you like a few example creatives?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,How do you pick the right market and price point?,faqs/leads,"You choose the city; we run local data through our AI tool to find price‑point + offer ‘sweet spots’ where cost per lead and buyer intent line up. If CPL climbs, we pivot to a nearby city or new angle. Want us to price your city now?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Is there a limit to how many markets I can run?,faqs/budget_scale,"We start with one primary and one backup market. When the first funnel hums, we layer on a second or third area intentionally so quality stays high. Sound good?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do I have to run this full‑time?,faqs/time,No. Many agents run the funnel alongside their existing business. The key is fast response to new leads and sticking to the 10‑day plan. Fair?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Can I pause the ads if I get too busy?,faqs/budget_scale,"Yes—because the campaigns live in your account, you can throttle budget up or down. I recommend throttling instead of hard‑off so momentum doesn’t reset. Make sense?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What budget do I need for ads?,faqs/budget_scale,"We start at $10/day (~$300/month). Once the unit economics work in your market, you can scale to $20–$30/day. Would it be a bad idea to test for 14 days at $10/day and judge by the numbers?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Are there any other marketing costs?,faqs/fees,"Outside of your ad spend and standard eXp fees, there’s no platform retainer for our system. Lenders can co‑sponsor to offset ad budget. Sound good?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do you provide lender partners?,faqs/budget_scale,Yes—we can introduce lender partners who will co‑market and cover part (or all) of the ad spend in exchange for branding in the follow‑up. Want an intro?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do you handle A2P and compliance?,faqs/onboarding,"Yes—our ops team registers your numbers for A2P texting, links API Nation to kvCORE, and ensures Special Ad Category compliance on Facebook/Instagram. Clear?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do you set up my CRM automations?,faqs/tools,"Yes—kvCORE smart campaigns, tags, tasks, and long‑term nurture so every lead gets worked automatically. Want me to show a sample flow?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do you provide call scripts and follow‑up training?,faqs/training,"Absolutely—weekly coaching covers scripts, dialogues, and role‑plays so your delivery feels natural. We focus on conversations and appointments, not theory. Helpful?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What kind of training is included?,faqs/training,"You’ll have my weekly marketing/AI calls, open Q&A, plus eXp’s extensive live class calendar and our private community for quick answers. Does that support level work for you?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do I need to record my own videos?,faqs/tools,"Optional. Agents who record short local videos generally see higher engagement, but our ads perform without on‑camera content. Want starter scripts if/when you’re ready?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do you supply social‑media content?,faqs/tools,"Yes—short‑form videos, carousels, and templates you can brand and publish. We’ll load a content starter kit for you. Sound useful?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Can I use my own branding?,faqs/brand,"Absolutely—it’s your face, logo, and colors. eXp branding is secondary; your local brand leads. Comfortable with that approach?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do you help with my YouTube channel?,faqs/tools,Yes—we’ll design banners/cover art/thumbnails and outline playlists and content ideas tailored to your market. Want us to mock up your channel?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What’s in the follow‑up sequence?,faqs/training,Day‑1: multiple attempts in the first 5–10 minutes. Days 1–10: calls + texts per the plan. After that: email/video messages and remarketing for months. Most wins come from consistent touches. Make sense?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What’s the difference between Funnel Pilot and the Accelerate program?,faqs/programs,Pilot is our hands‑on build‑and‑launch service. Accelerate layers additional campaigns and markets once the base funnel is performing. Which stage fits you today—launch or scale?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Who controls the lead routing?,faqs/team,"You do—leads flow into your CRM and can route to you, your spouse, or your team via round‑robin, ponds, or first‑to‑claim. Want us to configure routing rules for you?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,How many calls per day should I make?,faqs/training,Call new leads five times on day one and follow the 10‑day plan. Persistence wins—most people don’t answer the first attempt. Fair?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What qualifies me to join?,faqs/eligibility,"Be committed to growth, willing to invest at least $300/month in ads, and ready to work the leads. Production level matters less than consistency. Are you good with that?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,I’m brand new—can I still join?,faqs/new_agent,Yes—this is ideal for building your pipeline quickly. eXp training and broker support help you master contracts and transaction flow while we feed the top of the funnel. Sound good?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do I need a certain number of deals under my belt?,faqs/eligibility,"No hard requirement—agents with some experience ramp faster, but new agents succeed by sticking to the system. Want a 90‑day ramp plan?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What if I’m part of a team?,faqs/team,"We can build a funnel for the team lead and route to members, or give each member their own funnel. The system supports both. Which setup do you prefer?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Can brokers use this system?,faqs/broker,Yes—brokers run funnels to feed their agents and to recruit producers. We’ll configure routing and dashboards accordingly. Want to see a broker layout?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Can I recruit agents with this?,faqs/recruiting,"Sure—share the webinar and your story. If they partner under you, you earn revenue share. Recruiting is optional; production comes first. Fair?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do I have to recruit agents to participate?,faqs/recruiting,No. Many partners focus purely on production and never recruit. Revenue share is optional upside once you’re ready. Make sense?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,How does revenue share work?,faqs/recruiting,"When agents you sponsor close transactions, eXp pays you from the company’s 20%—not the agent’s. As your group produces more, your share grows within their plan. Want a quick math walkthrough?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What is the ICON program?,faqs/exp_model,"After you cap and then close roughly 20 transactions, you achieve ICON and receive your $16,000 cap back in company stock. It’s production‑driven recognition. Helpful?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,How does co‑sponsorship work?,faqs/recruiting,You can co‑sponsor an agent alongside a primary. The upline sponsor receives the majority; co‑sponsor gets a smaller portion while supporting the agent’s success. Want details on the split?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,"If I co‑sponsor someone, how do we both benefit?",faqs/recruiting,Primary sponsor earns the main revenue share; co‑sponsor earns secondary share and often collaborates on marketing and training. It’s a win when the agent wins. Sound fair?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Can I use Lofty or BoldTrail instead of kvCORE?,faqs/tools,Yes—BoldTrail is essentially kvCORE. Lofty works too; you might lose a few native automations but we’ll configure equivalents. Which CRM are you on now?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do you work with international agents?,faqs/international,"Yes—eXp Canada and other countries are supported. We localize currency, copy, and compliance. Payouts flow in your currency. Want to confirm your province/country?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Is there French/Spanish support?,faqs/international,"eXp offers training in multiple languages. Our core assets are in English, but you can record content or translate scripts to your native language and we’ll adapt the funnel. Helpful?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do I need a physical office?,faqs/exp_model,"No—eXp is cloud‑based. If your state requires occasional space, use a coworking office (e.g., Regus) or local conference rooms as needed. Workable?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Who do I contact for day‑to‑day support?,faqs/support,"Our ops team—Cassie, Tracy, Braden, Hollie, and Jeff—guides setup and troubleshooting. You also have eXp broker support and peer groups. Comfortable with that coverage?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Is there a long‑term contract?,faqs/risk_exit,"No long‑term platform contract here. If you leave eXp, you keep your leads and assets; you’d just lose our team’s ongoing support. Fair enough?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do I keep my leads if I leave?,faqs/risk_exit,"Yes—everything lives in your accounts (ads, CRM, pages), so the database remains yours even if we part ways. Peace of mind?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What if I want to stop using the program?,faqs/risk_exit,You can pause or withdraw at any time. No penalty from us—you’d simply stop receiving ongoing optimization and support. Sound good?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do you guarantee closings?,faqs/expectations,We guarantee lead flow and transparency; closings require consistent follow‑up and skill. That’s why we coach weekly and track conversations → appointments → contracts. Reasonable?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,How do I track ROI?,faqs/metrics,"Dashboards show CPL, cost per conversation, appointments set, and contracts. You compare commission earned to ad spend to verify ROI. Want a sample report?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What metrics should I focus on?,faqs/metrics,"Watch two numbers: conversations and appointments. CPL matters, but conversations turn into contracts. We’ll keep those trending the right way. Make sense?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What if I’m in a rural market?,faqs/territory_market,"We widen radius, use land/new‑build angles, and if needed layer a nearby metro to maintain volume. It’s all about testing until CPL and intent align. Want to price your area?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Can you run ads for luxury or higher price points?,faqs/territory_market,"Yes—CPL is usually higher, but ROI can be great. We adjust creatives and budget to match the price tier and still aim for strong conversation volume. Helpful?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do you run new‑construction leads?,faqs/territory_market,"Absolutely—new construction is a staple. We build lists, guides, and remarketing around quick‑move‑ins and spec homes. Want that angle in your market?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do you run seller leads?,faqs/leads,"We start with buyers for speed, then layer seller remarketing and database mining to surface listings. A dedicated seller funnel is in development. Want to add seller nurture?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What about commercial real estate?,faqs/scope,We focus on residential. Commercial is a different beast and not currently supported. Fair?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,How should I handle the leads?,faqs/training,"Speed matters—call/text in the first five minutes, follow the 10‑day plan, and keep nurturing. Most deals come from the 2nd–5th attempts. Sound doable?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,How fast should I respond?,faqs/training,"Within five minutes whenever possible. If no answer, cycle through call + text touches the first day and across the 10‑day plan. That’s how you win. Make sense?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do you provide scripts?,faqs/training,"Yes—call scripts, text templates, and email copy. We practice in weekly role‑plays so it feels like you, not scripted. Helpful?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,How does your targeting work?,faqs/leads,"We use AI and migration data to target move‑likely buyers, and we always run in Meta’s Special Ad Category for housing to stay compliant. Clear enough?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do you use AI chatbots?,faqs/tools,"We use AI for creative and analysis, but prioritize human conversations. Automation starts the touch; you close the loop. That balance work for you?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,How do you stay compliant with Facebook’s housing rules?,faqs/compliance,"We set every campaign in the Special Ad Category: Housing and avoid targeting by age, gender, or other protected classes. Broker review is welcome. Sound good?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What if my Facebook ad account gets shut down?,faqs/onboarding,"We help appeal and, if needed, set up a new Business Manager. We’ve dealt with this before—no panic, just process. Fair?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What if I don’t have a Facebook account?,faqs/onboarding,"We walk you through creating a Business Manager, adding payment, and verifying your domain so we can launch fast. Easy enough?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do I need to give you my credit card?,faqs/fees,No—we never bill you for ad spend. You pay Facebook directly and keep full control of budget and limits. Comfortable with that?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Will I overspend on ads?,faqs/budget_scale,No—the campaigns are set to a daily budget cap. Start at $10/day and scale only when ROI is proven. Would you like a scaling checklist?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,How often are coaching calls?,faqs/training,"Weekly marketing/AI sessions with me plus open Q&A; eXp offers daily classes on production, contracts, and marketing. Enough support?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What if I can’t attend a call?,faqs/training,All calls are recorded; you can watch replays and send questions to the team. Helpful?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do you provide sphere‑of‑influence marketing?,faqs/tools,Yes—upload your database to kvCORE; we’ll run newsletters and remarketing so you stay top‑of‑mind with past clients. Want that enabled at launch?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Can I market to out‑of‑state buyers?,faqs/leads,"Absolutely—many campaigns target inbound movers (e.g., CA → TX). We’ll tune copy to migration trends. Want to see an example?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do you support multiple languages?,faqs/international,Yes—record content in your language if you prefer; we’ll adapt templates. eXp provides multilingual training resources. Does that help?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do you help with contract to close?,faqs/scope,We focus on demand gen and nurture; your eXp broker and classes cover contract‑to‑close. Clear hand‑off?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,How do you choose ad copy and images?,faqs/leads,"We test multiple headlines and creatives—underperformers get replaced within days. It’s a data game, not guesswork. Make sense?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Can I use my existing ads?,faqs/leads,"We’ll review what you’ve run and keep what works, but we typically rebuild clean to ensure tracking, compliance, and speed. Fair approach?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do you run ads on Instagram or YouTube?,faqs/leads,Meta includes Facebook + Instagram. We encourage posting content to YouTube organically; we don’t run paid YouTube ads in this program. Good?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do you help with open houses?,faqs/scope,"We can advise how to invite new leads to an open house, but we don’t run a separate open‑house funnel right now. Useful?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Can I integrate my own website?,faqs/tools,"Yes—landing pages can redirect to your site or kvCORE pages, and we can embed MLS search on custom pages if needed. Want that wired in?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What if I’m in another coaching program?,faqs/training,That’s fine—this complements most programs. Many agents eventually replace other paid coaching once this pipeline is rolling. Does that help?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Are there any hidden fees?,faqs/fees,"No hidden platform fees here. Aside from eXp’s standard structure and your ad spend, there’s no retainer for our system. Comfortable with that?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,How do you make money if you aren’t charging me?,faqs/exp_model,Through eXp revenue share when agents I sponsor produce. I win when you win—that’s why the incentives are aligned. Fair enough?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What if I’m not ready to leave my brokerage?,faqs/exp_model,"You can buy the service à la carte (~$15k), but partnering at eXp is usually the smarter long‑term move. Want to compare both paths side‑by‑side?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Can I try the system before committing?,faqs/onboarding,I’ll show you the funnel and data. We don’t run paid ads until you choose whether to join or pay the implementation fee. Want a quick tour?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What if my spouse/partner is also an agent?,faqs/team,"Couples can join together—one is the sponsor, the other partners through them. We can route leads to both of you. Workable?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Which states do you support?,faqs/international,All 50 states plus Canadian provinces via eXp Canada. Local compliance goes through your broker. Which market are you in?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Are there testimonials I can see?,faqs/proof,Yes—happy to share dashboards and connect you with partners who closed in their first 60–90 days. Want intros?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What if I’m in a low‑price market?,faqs/territory_market,Lower price points often mean even lower CPL. We tune messaging to highlight affordability and still drive quality conversations. Shall we price your city?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,How many campaigns do you run at once?,faqs/leads,Typically two to three creatives at launch. We replace underperformers quickly to keep CPL tight. That pace okay?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,How do you know which ads work?,faqs/leads,"Click‑through, cost per lead, and conversation rate tell us what’s winning. We monitor every few days and iterate. Data over opinions. Good approach?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Can my lender pay for the ads?,faqs/budget_scale,Yes—co‑marketing is common. Lenders cover part or all of ad spend in exchange for compliant co‑branding. Want an intro template?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Who pays for the ads?,faqs/budget_scale,You control the ad account and spend; lenders or team splits can offset. We’ll help structure it cleanly. Sound good?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What if my state has strict advertising rules?,faqs/compliance,Your eXp broker reviews the ads for state‑specific rules. We customize disclaimers and footers so you’re covered. Helpful?
,,,,jay_faqs_master,Do you help me recruit agents?,faqs/recruiting,"Yes—once your funnel is steady, we’ll show you how to share the webinar and have the conversation ethically. Our team often joins those calls. Good plan?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What’s expected of me in the first 30 days?,faqs/onboarding,"Set up Business Manager + kvCORE, attend onboarding, approve ads, and call every new lead quickly. Success is measured by conversations in month one and a deal under contract ASAP. Fair?"
,,,,jay_faqs_master,What does success look like over the long term?,faqs/strategy,"Consistent ad spend, disciplined follow‑up, adding markets when ready, and optionally recruiting agents. The goal is freedom through production and (if you choose) revenue share. Ready to start?"
