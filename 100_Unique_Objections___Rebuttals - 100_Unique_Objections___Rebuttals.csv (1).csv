#,Objection,100-ZERO Rebuttal
1,I don’t want to pay the $297/month fee.,"“I get it. Let me ask you — if $297 could buy you two clients a month, would you do it? One closing pays 10–15K. That’s not an expense, that’s an ATM. Winners don’t ask ‘how much does it cost?’ They ask, ‘how much does it make me?’ So are you ready to turn $297 into a deal this month?”"
2,I’m already paying for leads; why pay again?,"“Exactly. You’re already paying — but those other leads are retail. Ours are wholesale. We cut cost per lead down to $3–$5. You can keep renting from Zillow, or you can own the machine yourself. Would you rather rent your future or own it?”"
3,What if I don’t get ROI on the $300 ad budget?,"“Here’s the truth: $300 is one dinner in real estate. And if you follow up the way we show you, ROI isn’t a possibility — it’s inevitable. The only way you don’t win is if you quit. Let’s stop worrying about losing $300 and focus on how fast we can turn it into $10K.”"
4,I can’t afford to switch brokerages right now.,"“That’s exactly why you can’t afford to stay. If your current brokerage hasn’t given you the freedom to make this decision, it’s already costing you money. The best time to change is when you feel the squeeze. The worst mistake is waiting another year in the same spot.”"
5,I don’t want to split revenue share with anyone.,"“Revenue share is found money. Would you rather have 100% of nothing, or a percentage of passive income that pays every month? It’s like a royalty check — if you don’t want them, I’ll take yours.”"
6,I’m worried about losing income during the transition.,"“Every agent has had that fear, and every one of them says later, ‘I wish I’d done it sooner.’ The transition isn’t downtime — it’s plug-and-play. You keep selling while we build the machine. No lost income, only gained leverage.”"
7,I already have a system that works; why pay more?,"“Great. That means you know the value of a system. Now imagine keeping yours AND adding ours — doubling your results. The question isn’t ‘why pay more,’ it’s ‘why limit yourself?’ Champions stack advantages.”"
8,I don’t believe Facebook ads will generate quality leads in my market.,"“Do you believe in data? We’ve run these campaigns in over 50 markets — from Dallas to tiny towns — and the numbers don’t lie: $3–$5 leads, 75–100 a month. If it works in Canada, Puerto Rico, and rural areas, it’ll work in yours. The only question is whether your name is on the ad or your competitor’s.”"
9,Zillow/Realtor.com leads are expensive but at least predictable.,"“Predictable robbery isn’t a win. Zillow sells the same leads to your competition at 3–4X the cost. With us, you own the pipeline and you’re the only one touching your leads. Would you rather rent overpriced, recycled names, or own your own?”"
10,I don’t want another monthly subscription.,“Subscriptions drain you when they don’t produce. This isn’t Netflix — it’s a business multiplier. Every dollar in pays back tenfold. Would you cancel a subscription that puts clients on your calendar every week?”
11,Online leads are garbage and never convert.,"“Garbage in, garbage out. Bad systems produce bad leads. Our campaigns target buyers and sellers already in motion — relocation, new construction, move-ups. With our scripts, 1 in 20 turns into a deal. If online leads never converted, no one would be selling houses.”"
12,I don’t want to chase cold internet leads.,"“Neither do I. That’s why we built the system so you don’t chase — you attract. When someone clicks a new construction ad, they’re raising their hand. That’s not cold; that’s warm. You just need to answer the phone.”"
13,I’ve tried Facebook ads before and they didn’t work.,"“I believe you. But ads don’t fail, strategies do. If you’ve never been taught direct response marketing, you’re throwing darts blindfolded. We’ve tested millions of dollars. We know what headlines, hooks, and offers work. You don’t have to guess anymore.”"
14,I don’t have time to follow up quickly on leads.,"“And that’s exactly why you need automation. Our system calls, texts, and emails the second a lead comes in, so you’re only picking up when someone’s engaged. Time isn’t your enemy — it’s how you leverage it.”"
15,Automation feels impersonal.,"“It’s not about robots replacing you. It’s about robots opening the door so you can walk in. Would you rather lose a lead because you couldn’t call in five minutes, or have automation buy you that chance?”"
16,I don’t believe you can actually deliver $3–$5 leads.,"“Fair doubt. That’s why we show live accounts, not theory. Agents in Amarillo, Ohio, Puerto Rico — all closing $300 leads into $10K commissions. Don’t believe me — believe the bank deposits.”"
17,My market is too competitive for Facebook ads.,"“Competition proves there’s money to be made. When everyone zigs, we zag — with niche ads that stand out. Builders, move-ups, geo-targets. The only agents who lose in competitive markets are the ones without a proven edge.”"
18,New construction ads won’t work in my area.,"“They said the same in Amarillo — until builders started calling our agents asking to list their communities. Every market has someone building, and buyers looking. If you don’t take that lane, your competitor will.”"
19,IDX lead capture never produces serious buyers.,"“IDX fails when you bait with fluff. We bait with urgency: just listed, just sold, builder incentives. That attracts people already shopping. IDX isn’t broken — it just needs the right hook. We give you that.”"
20,Builders already have their own agents; why would they work with me?,"“Because builders care about one thing — moving inventory. When your ads drive traffic they can’t get themselves, they see you as an asset, not a threat. We’ve had builders hand over listings just for running our ads. Would you like to be the agent they call, or watch someone else get the call?”"
21,I’m not tech-savvy.,"“That’s why we built this so you don’t have to be. You don’t need to know how to build the car — you just need to know how to drive it. We give you the keys, we fuel it, and we even set the GPS. Can you answer the phone? Then you can run this system.”"
22,I get overwhelmed with CRMs and funnels.,"“Of course you do — they’re built to confuse you so you stay stuck. We simplified it to one dashboard, one login, one system. No overwhelm. Just appointments showing up. Would it help if the tech stress disappeared?”"
23,I don’t want to learn another platform.,"“You don’t have to. We do the learning, setup, and running. You get the benefit. It’s like hiring a pilot — you don’t go to flight school, you just get to the destination.”"
24,Automation is too complicated.,"“It is if you try to build it yourself. But when it’s done for you, automation is just leverage. Think of it like power steering — complicated under the hood, simple behind the wheel.”"
25,I don’t trust AI follow-up.,"“AI isn’t here to replace you. It’s here to open the door so you can walk in. It never gets tired, never forgets, and always calls in five minutes. It just sets you up to be the hero in the conversation.”"
26,I don’t want to be stuck in ‘tech training’ instead of selling.,“Neither do I. That’s why we handle the tech while you stay face-to-face with clients. Our training is about what to say when the phone rings — not coding funnels. Wouldn’t you rather sell than troubleshoot?”
27,Tech changes too fast; I’ll get left behind.,"“That’s exactly why you need us. We absorb the changes so you don’t have to. Every time Facebook or Google updates, we adjust — and you just keep getting leads. You’ll never fall behind because we’re already ahead.”"
28,I’ve had bad experiences with tech vendors.,"“So have I. Most of them overpromise and underdeliver. We’re different because we eat our own cooking — these are the exact funnels we use to sell and recruit. We’re not selling theory, we’re sharing what’s already working.”"
29,I don’t want my clients spammed with automation.,"“Neither do we. Spam pushes people away. Our system engages with value — listings, incentives, real offers. That’s why our follow-up gets replies instead of complaints. Would you agree trust beats spam?”"
30,I’d rather just cold call.,“That’s fine — but let’s be real. Do you want to chase or attract? Cold calling is rejection by design. Marketing is attraction by design. The top producers don’t choose between them — they stack them.”
31,I don’t want to switch brokerages.,"“Nobody loves change. But growth requires it. If staying put was enough, you wouldn’t even be looking at this. The fact you’re here proves you’re searching. Don’t let comfort cost you opportunity.”"
32,I’m loyal to my current broker.,"“I respect loyalty. But loyalty without growth is slavery. A broker who really supports you would want you to build wealth, not just closings. Loyalty to family is noble. Loyalty to someone capping your potential is costly.”"
33,I don’t want to burn bridges with my current team.,"“You don’t burn bridges by growing. You simply outgrow them. And guess what? When they see you thriving, many of them will follow. You’re not abandoning anyone — you’re leading the way.”"
34,eXp feels like MLM/recruiting-focused.,"“That’s the lazy label people use when they don’t understand. eXp is a brokerage first — cloud-based, low overhead, huge value. Revenue share is simply a bonus stream, like a royalty. If you don’t want to recruit, don’t — you’ll still win.”"
35,I don’t want to be pressured to recruit agents.,"“Good. Don’t recruit. Nobody’s forcing you. Focus on selling — our system makes that easier. Recruiting is an optional wealth path, not a requirement.”"
36,I’m comfortable at a boutique brokerage.,"“Comfort is the enemy of growth. A boutique may feel cozy, but does it give you stock, revenue share, and a $50K/month marketing team? Or just comfort? You can have both culture AND scale at eXp.”"
37,I like the culture where I’m at.,"“Culture is great, but culture doesn’t pay the bills. eXp has culture, too — just global, connected, and collaborative. You can love your friends at your old office — and love your bank account here.”"
38,My broker gives me good splits already.,"“Splits are short-term. Wealth is long-term. Even at a good split, you’re capped by hours in the day. With stock and revenue share, you earn beyond closings. Would you rather save a few percent today, or build real wealth for tomorrow?”"
39,I don’t want to lose local office support.,"“Fair. But local offices are a crutch. The truth is, your business happens on your phone and laptop. We plug you into a national network of top producers who’ll out-support any brick-and-mortar.”"
40,I don’t see the value of eXp stock options.,“Then you haven’t looked closely. Agents have built six- and seven-figure retirement accounts simply by doing what they’re already doing — closing deals. Stock is free ownership. Why say no to free equity?”
