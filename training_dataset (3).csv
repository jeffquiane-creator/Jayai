jay_objections,I don't want to switch brokerages because of the split—why would I move?,objections/fees,"Totally fair. With eXp you start 80/20 with a $16k cap; once you cap you’re 100% and only pay small transaction fees. My marketing machine is included when you partner, so instead of paying a vendor $15k–$30k a year, you redirect that budget into ads you control. Net-net: lower fixed cost, more upside, and you own the pipeline we build."
jay_objections,Why would I change my split just to join you?,objections/fees,"Great question. Totally fair. With eXp you start 80/20 with a $16k cap; once you cap you’re 100% and only pay small transaction fees. My marketing machine is included when you partner, so instead of paying a vendor $15k–$30k a year, you redirect that budget into ads you control. Net-net: lower fixed cost, more upside, and you own the pipeline we build."
jay_objections,Are there surprise charges beyond the cap and split?,objections/fees,"Totally fair. Totally fair. With eXp you start 80/20 with a $16k cap; once you cap you’re 100% and only pay small transaction fees. My marketing machine is included when you partner, so instead of paying a vendor $15k–$30k a year, you redirect that budget into ads you control. Net-net: lower fixed cost, more upside, and you own the pipeline we build."
jay_objections,Are there any hidden platform fees or upsells with your program?,objections/fees,"No platform fee, no retainer. You cover your ad spend (we start at ~$10/day) and the normal eXp fees. Our team does the buildout, creative, and tech at no charge when you partner. If you ever leave, you keep your leads and ad accounts."
jay_objections,I’ve heard caps and fees vary; what’s the actual cost structure?,objections/fees,"It’s simple: 80/20 split until you hit a $16k cap, then 100%. After capping there’s a small per-transaction fee until ICON. No monthly desk fees. Your main variable cost is ad spend—which we tune so ROI stays positive."
jay_objections,Are the leads exclusive to me or shared?,objections/leads,"They’re yours. Ads run in your own Meta account and point into your CRM. We don’t resell or recycle them. You can pause or scale spend any time, but don’t shut the pipeline off completely—consistency wins."
jay_objections,"Are these leads truly exclusive, or do others get them too?",objections/leads,"Great question. They’re yours. Ads run in your own Meta account and point into your CRM. We don’t resell or recycle them. You can pause or scale spend any time, but don’t shut the pipeline off completely—consistency wins."
jay_objections,How do your leads compare to Zillow or portal leads?,objections/leads,"Totally fair. They’re yours. Ads run in your own Meta account and point into your CRM. We don’t resell or recycle them. You can pause or scale spend any time, but don’t shut the pipeline off completely—consistency wins."
jay_objections,What’s the quality like compared to Zillow or portal leads?,objections/leads,Portals sell the same prospect to multiple agents. We target move-ready buyers and build your list at $3–$5 CPL. You’ll have more conversations for the same budget and you own the data forever.
jay_objections,Will this work in my market right now?,objections/leads,"Yes—we use market data to set price points and creative that match current demand. If CPL rises, we pivot: new hooks, new submarkets, or a nearby city. The playbook is test, measure, and iterate quickly."
jay_objections,I don’t have time to manage another system.,objections/time,"We do the heavy lifting—ads, landing pages, automations, A2P, reporting. Your job is the five-minute rule and the follow‑up plan we give you. If you can commit 60–90 minutes a day to conversations, this works."
jay_objections,I’m slammed—how much time will this take each day?,objections/time,"Great question. We do the heavy lifting—ads, landing pages, automations, A2P, reporting. Your job is the five-minute rule and the follow‑up plan we give you. If you can commit 60–90 minutes a day to conversations, this works."
jay_objections,What if I get overwhelmed—can I throttle the ads?,objections/time,"Totally fair. We do the heavy lifting—ads, landing pages, automations, A2P, reporting. Your job is the five-minute rule and the follow‑up plan we give you. If you can commit 60–90 minutes a day to conversations, this works."
jay_objections,What if I get too busy—can I pause?,objections/time,"Yes, you control spend inside your ad account. We recommend throttling down rather than hard‑off so the algorithm and pipeline don’t reset."
jay_objections,How long until I see closings?,objections/time,"Leads start day one, appointments in week one, and most partners see first closings in 60–90 days. That timeline compresses when you follow the contact cadence and scripts we provide."
jay_objections,I’m not tech savvy—how hard is onboarding?,objections/onboarding,"We do it with you: Business Manager, pixels, domains, A2P registration, API Nation, kvCORE automations, templates. You approve creatives and record a couple of short videos if you want—everything else is handled."
jay_objections,I’m not techy—who handles setup?,objections/onboarding,"Great question. We do it with you: Business Manager, pixels, domains, A2P registration, API Nation, kvCORE automations, templates. You approve creatives and record a couple of short videos if you want—everything else is handled."
jay_objections,Can I keep my current CRM and workflows?,objections/onboarding,"Totally fair. We do it with you: Business Manager, pixels, domains, A2P registration, API Nation, kvCORE automations, templates. You approve creatives and record a couple of short videos if you want—everything else is handled."
jay_objections,Can I use my existing CRM like kvCORE/Lofty/Chime?,objections/onboarding,"Yes. kvCORE is native; Lofty and Chime work fine. We load your smart campaigns, tags, and tasks so every lead gets worked automatically."
jay_objections,Who owns the assets if I leave?,objections/onboarding,"You do—ad account, pages, landing pages, and database. We’re building your machine inside your accounts, not ours."
jay_objections,Do I have to recruit to benefit from this?,objections/exp_model,No. Many partners never recruit a single agent. You can build a big business on production alone; revenue share is optional upside when you’re ready.
jay_objections,Do I need to recruit agents to make this worthwhile?,objections/exp_model,Great question. No. Many partners never recruit a single agent. You can build a big business on production alone; revenue share is optional upside when you’re ready.
jay_objections,Can I just pay for the build and stay put at my brokerage?,objections/exp_model,Totally fair. No. Many partners never recruit a single agent. You can build a big business on production alone; revenue share is optional upside when you’re ready.
jay_objections,Can I just pay you and stay at my brokerage?,objections/exp_model,"If you insist, we can do a paid implementation—but I’d rather you keep your money. Partnering at eXp unlocks our team, training, and updates long‑term without a big check up front."
jay_objections,What changes day‑to‑day if I join eXp?,objections/exp_model,"You keep your brand and clients. You gain a cloud brokerage with broker support, stock/ICON opportunities, and our marketing engine layered on top."
jay_objections,I’ve tried lead gen vendors before and got burned.,objections/skepticism,"Same. That’s why we build in your accounts so you own everything. We show you CPL, conversations, and appointments in a dashboard so there’s transparency. If an angle stops working, we change it fast."
jay_objections,Vendors burned me before—why is this different?,objections/skepticism,"Great question. Same. That’s why we build in your accounts so you own everything. We show you CPL, conversations, and appointments in a dashboard so there’s transparency. If an angle stops working, we change it fast."
jay_objections,Do you have proof or case studies I can see?,objections/skepticism,"Totally fair. Same. That’s why we build in your accounts so you own everything. We show you CPL, conversations, and appointments in a dashboard so there’s transparency. If an angle stops working, we change it fast."
jay_objections,What proof do you have that this works?,objections/skepticism,"We’ll share real campaigns, dashboards, and partners you can call. The system isn’t theory—it’s running every day across multiple markets."
jay_objections,What if Facebook bans my ad account?,objections/skepticism,"We follow Housing rules, verify your business, and keep backups. If something flags, we appeal and pivot creative. You won’t be stuck without a plan."
jay_objections,I hate cold calling—do I have to?,objections/conversion,"We’re not cold calling—we’re calling people who requested info. You’ll use short, friendly openers and a 10‑day plan. Text + voicemail drops handle most of the touches; you focus on real conversations."
jay_objections,I really dislike cold calls—is that required?,objections/conversion,"Great question. We’re not cold calling—we’re calling people who requested info. You’ll use short, friendly openers and a 10‑day plan. Text + voicemail drops handle most of the touches; you focus on real conversations."
jay_objections,What conversion should I plan on from these leads?,objections/conversion,"Totally fair. We’re not cold calling—we’re calling people who requested info. You’ll use short, friendly openers and a 10‑day plan. Text + voicemail drops handle most of the touches; you focus on real conversations."
jay_objections,What should I expect for conversion rates?,objections/conversion,"Every market is different, but we track two numbers: conversations and appointments. At $3–$5 CPL and consistent follow‑up, partners typically land 1–3 closings per 100 leads over the first 90 days, then it compounds from the database."
jay_objections,What if leads stop responding?,objections/conversion,"We recycle them with remarketing, new offers, and long‑term nurture in kvCORE. Many of your later deals come from month‑two and month‑three follow‑ups."
jay_objections,Will this hurt my brand voice?,objections/brand,"It’s your brand. Ads run with your name, photo, and colors. We supply proven frameworks and you localize them."
jay_objections,Will your ads dilute my personal brand?,objections/brand,"Great question. It’s your brand. Ads run with your name, photo, and colors. We supply proven frameworks and you localize them."
jay_objections,Is everything compliant with housing rules?,objections/brand,"Totally fair. It’s your brand. Ads run with your name, photo, and colors. We supply proven frameworks and you localize them."
jay_objections,Is this compliant with Fair Housing and my state rules?,objections/brand,Yes—every campaign uses the Special Ad Category and state‑specific disclaimers. Your broker can review assets before launch.
jay_objections,Do I have to be on camera?,objections/brand,"It helps, but it’s not mandatory. We have ad variants that don’t require video. When you’re ready, we’ll script short videos that take 10 minutes to record."
jay_objections,I can only spend $300 a month—enough?,objections/budget,"Yes, that’s how most partners start. We prove the unit economics at $10/day, then scale to $20–$30/day once you’re converting."
jay_objections,Is $10/day really enough to start?,objections/budget,"Great question. Yes, that’s how most partners start. We prove the unit economics at $10/day, then scale to $20–$30/day once you’re converting."
jay_objections,Can my lender chip in on ad spend?,objections/budget,"Totally fair. Yes, that’s how most partners start. We prove the unit economics at $10/day, then scale to $20–$30/day once you’re converting."
jay_objections,Can a lender co‑market and cover ad spend?,objections/budget,Absolutely—many do. We co‑brand compliant assets and give the lender reporting on the pipeline they’re helping fund.
jay_objections,What happens when I scale budget?,objections/budget,"We increase radius, add creatives, and split‑test new hooks. Scale should increase conversations, not just impressions."
jay_objections,Do you lock territories?,objections/territory,"No, because the leads are in your own account and brand. If a nearby market is hot, we can add a second city once your first funnel hums."
jay_objections,Is there any territory protection?,objections/territory,"Great question. No, because the leads are in your own account and brand. If a nearby market is hot, we can add a second city once your first funnel hums."
jay_objections,Will this work for luxury buyers or new builds?,objections/territory,"Totally fair. No, because the leads are in your own account and brand. If a nearby market is hot, we can add a second city once your first funnel hums."
jay_objections,Does this work for luxury or new construction?,objections/niche,"Yes—CPL is higher for luxury but ROI is strong. New construction is a staple: builder lists, spec homes, and quick‑move‑ins perform well."
jay_objections,My area is rural—will it still work?,objections/rural,"We’ll widen the radius, adjust price points, and test land/new‑build hooks. We can also layer a nearby metro to maintain volume."
jay_objections,How long does full implementation take from signup to go‑live?,objections/implementation,"We move fast: A2P registration takes ~7–10 days, creative and CRM build run in parallel, and we launch as soon as compliance clears. Expect your first leads within the first week we go live."
jay_objections,Do you or eXp own my database if I leave?,objections/ownership,"You own your database, ad accounts, and creative. Everything is built in your assets; if you ever leave, you take it with you."
jay_objections,Do you give me call scripts and text templates?,objections/scripts,"Yes—day‑1 openers, 10‑day plan, long‑term nurture, and objection handlers. We also role‑play weekly so the words feel natural."
jay_objections,What ongoing training do I get beyond launch?,objections/training,"Weekly coaching with me on marketing and conversion, plus eXp’s daily classes and our private community for quick answers."
jay_objections,How do I track ROI so I know this is working?,objections/metrics,"We show you CPL, conversations, appointments, and contracts. When those are trending the right way, closings follow. If something dips, we adjust the inputs immediately."
jay_objections,I don’t have content—do you provide assets?,objections/content,"We give you ad copy, images, and short‑form scripts. You can record local clips in 10 minutes; we’ll handle the rest."
jay_objections,Do you set up emails and automations for me?,objections/email,"Yes—kvCORE smart campaigns with text, email, and tasking. Every new lead gets worked automatically so nobody slips through."
jay_objections,Is texting compliant—what about A2P and opt‑in?,objections/optin,"We register your brand and numbers for A2P, include compliant language on forms, and throttle sends so deliverability stays high."
jay_objections,Can I route leads to my team members?,objections/teams,"Absolutely—round‑robin, ponds, or first‑to‑claim. We’ll match the routing to your team structure."
jay_objections,Can I talk to agents already using this?,objections/proof,Yes—happy to connect you with partners in markets similar to yours so you can hear their experience directly.
jay_objections,What if I try it and decide eXp isn’t for me?,objections/exit,"No hard feelings. You can leave anytime, and you keep your leads and infrastructure. We want you to win—here or anywhere."
jay_objections,Can I add a second market later?,objections/multi_market,"Yes—once the first funnel is consistent, we’ll add another city or price tier and duplicate the playbook."
jay_objections,Do you have examples of luxury ad creatives?,objections/luxury,"We do—clean, brand‑forward creatives that highlight inventory and lifestyle. We’ll test price points to keep CPL sane."
jay_objections,Can we generate seller opportunities too?,objections/seller,"We start with buyers for speed, then layer seller remarketing and database mining to surface listings."
jay_objections,I’m nervous on camera—any tips?,objections/video,"Keep it simple: 20–30 second clips, talk to one person, and smile. We give you prompts; you record on your phone. Done."
jay_objections,Can you integrate with my calendar for appointments?,objections/calendar,Yes—calendar links live in your automations so prospects can book directly. We also teach you how to convert to live calls.
jay_objections,Do you run Google PPC as well?,objections/ppc,We start with Meta for cost efficiency and add PPC later if it makes sense for your market and budget.
jay_objections,Why not just keep buying Zillow leads?,objections/zillow,Zillow is renting. This is owning. For the same budget you’ll have 10–20× more conversations and an asset that grows over time.
jay_objections,I’m worried moving brokerages will confuse my clients.,objections/brand_switch,"Your clients care about you, not the logo. We’ll script the announcement so it feels like an upgrade in service, not a disruption."
jay_objections,What if I need appointments this week?,objections/pipeline,We can turn on remarketing to your database and use speed‑to‑lead tactics while the new ads ramp up.
jay_objections,Will you run Google PPC as well?,objections/ppc,Quick one: We start with Meta for cost efficiency and add PPC later if it makes sense for your market and budget.
jay_objections,So what if I need appointments this week?,objections/pipeline,Quick one: We can turn on remarketing to your database and use speed‑to‑lead tactics while the new ads ramp up.
jay_objections,I don't want to switch brokerages because of the split—why would I move? (from a team leader’s perspective),objections/fees,"Totally fair. With eXp you start 80/20 with a $16k cap; once you cap you’re 100% and only pay small transaction fees. My marketing machine is included when you partner, so instead of paying a vendor $15k–$30k a year, you redirect that budget into ads you control. Net-net: lower fixed cost, more upside, and you own the pipeline we build."

After capping there’s a small per-transaction fee until ICON. No monthly desk fees. Your main variable cost is ad spend—which we tune so ROI stays positive."
